    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with a bullish lean (60-100% bullish across sources), but structural bearish risks create meaningful uncertainty. Conviction is MEDIUM—near-term momentum favors bulls, but earnings deterioration and geopolitical tail risks underpin defensive positioning.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Precious metals and crypto institutional adoption narratives driving alternative asset flows; (2) Fed rate-cut expectations supporting risk assets despite earnings downgrades across fintech/software/pharma; (3) Technology sector divergence—AI/semiconductors decoupling upward while enterprise software faces margin compression; (4) Geopolitical escalation risks and Treasury market stress signals (delivery failures at 8-year highs) creating hedging demand.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—DORMANT). Max Pain $686. Near resistance: $730 (5.7% away), $750 (8.6% away). Near support: $670 (2.9% away—ACTIVE), $645 (6.6% away—DORMANT). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—DORMANT). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (0.2%—ACTIVE). Near support: $585 (6.2% away—DORMANT). Both indices show BULLISH_SUPPORT bias with active dealer hedging near resistance.",

QQQ: Resistance at $625 (0.2% away—immediately testing) and $630 (Call Wall, 33k OI). Support at $585 (5.4% away—dormant until approached). Watch for breakout above $630 in QQQ or sustained hold above $700 in SPY to confirm intraday bullish momentum.",

Swing support at $670 (active), $645 (6.6% away, 126k OI—dormant), and $640 (Put Wall, 153k OI). QQQ: Swing resistance at $640 (2.6%, 31k OI—active), $650+ untested. Swing support at $585 (6.2%, 137k OI—dormant) and $590 (Put Wall, 164k OI).
