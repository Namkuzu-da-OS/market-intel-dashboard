    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is mixed with HIGH conviction bearish signals in precious metals (silver showing technical exhaustion) contrasting with MEDIUM conviction bullish momentum in broad indices and commodities. Overall market bias is NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH on equities but vulnerable to sector-specific correction.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Precious metals overbought exhaustion vs. commodity supercycle narrative bifurcation; (2) Corporate earnings guidance deterioration in enterprise software and fintech creating valuation pressure; (3) Fed regulatory tightening and 'higher for longer' rates environment constraining leveraged sectors; (4) Momentum divergence warning (NASDAQ momentum screener at 116 names vs. normal 150+) signaling early breadth deterioration.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $625 (29k OI - active). Silver: Record high $82.50 as key breakout/support level per Twitter analysis; December 29 CME margin requirement ($25,000) noted as potential liquidation catalyst.",
