    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is broadly bullish (68% X, 57% RSS, 100% professional trader) but with deteriorating conviction and emerging technical warning signals. Confidence is MEDIUM - price strength masks underlying breadth weakness and sector-specific exhaustion.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Mega-cap tech and financials sustaining institutional accumulation despite breadth divergence; (2) Precious metals and commodities showing exhaustion after extreme overbought conditions, signaling potential mean reversion; (3) Defensive sector rotation underway as growth/discretionary faces earnings headwinds and regulatory constraints; (4) Geopolitical and regulatory risks creating safe-haven flows and limiting upside conviction.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant). Max Pain $686. Near resistance: $730, $750 (dormant). Near support: $670 (45k OI - active). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI - both active). Near support: $585 (137k OI - dormant).",

    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Potential pullback toward Max Pain $686 or deeper support at $670 if $700 resistance holds. Risk of further decline toward $640 put wall if breadth deterioration accelerates. QQQ: Resistance capping at $630 call wall; break below $625 opens decline toward $590 put wall (164k OI dormant support). Silver exhaustion (per Twitter analysis: 87% above 200-day MA, extreme overbought) and deteriorating crypto engagement suggest 1-5 day consolidation or pullback as institutional support softens.",
