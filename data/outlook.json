    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is cautiously bullish with medium conviction, but structural cracks are emerging beneath the surface. Macro narratives (monetary easing, AI productivity) clash with deteriorating micro fundamentals (guidance cuts, regulatory pressure, demand weakness).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Rotation dynamics—metals and financials at new highs vs. breadth deterioration; (2) Momentum exhaustion signals in momentum sectors (silver showing 5-8% intraday reversals, fewer breadth participants despite SPX ATHs); (3) Geopolitical risk-off positioning coexisting with risk-on macro bets; (4) Year-end options expiration volatility and positioning exhaustion.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $686. Near active support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—active hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $621. Near active resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.2%), $640 (31k OI, 2.6%). Both indices show bullish support bias but active dealer hedging near immediate resistance suggests consolidation risk.",

QQQ: Resistance at $625–$630 (call wall at $630 with 33k OI, 1.0% away; $625 with 29k OI). Watch for consolidation; breakout either direction depends on breadth confirmation. Monitor options expiration dynamics (Jan 2nd expirations cited in X summary).",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: Potential consolidation 1–5 days with downside bias if rotation logic falters. If $700 call wall holds, watch for pullback toward $670–$675 (max pain zone). Below $670, $640 put wall becomes active support (153k OI). QQQ: Similar consolidation risk; $625–$630 is critical—break below $625 targets $590 put wall (164k OI, 5.4% away). Swing traders should prepare for mean reversion in overextended sectors (silver, crypto per X summary) while monitoring if mega-cap tech/financials hold near-term highs.",
