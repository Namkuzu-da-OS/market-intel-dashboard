    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter shows strong bullish positioning (77% bullish) focused on AI/tech momentum, while RSS news and professional traders lean bearish (53% and 13% bullish respectively), citing guidance cuts, geopolitical tensions, and earnings quality concerns. The overall picture suggests a tactical consolidation phase with underlying structural uncertainty.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure demand and mega-cap tech leadership continuing to dominate; (2) Year-end profit-taking and rotation risk in small/mid-caps alongside low holiday volume vulnerability; (3) Geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.-China tensions, Taiwan/Ukraine risks) and policy/regulatory headwinds creating near-term friction despite long-term structural tailwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active), $625 (29k OI - active). Per Twitter: SPX range 6,940–7,000 cited as critical inflection zone.",

QQQ: Squeezed between $625–$630 call walls (both active)—breakout either direction likely. Watch for volume confirmation; low holiday liquidity may create false moves.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: 6,940–7,000 range (per Twitter) is critical inflection—failure below 6,940 could trigger broad liquidation. Put wall support at $640 (153k OI) is significant but dormant (7.3% away). QQQ: $590 put wall (164k OI) provides major support but is 5.4% away; near-term resistance capped at $630–$640. Breadth deterioration (Russell 2000 weakness) and crypto sector weakness suggest downside bias if SPX/SPY breaks support—expected direction: consolidation → downside into early 2026 unless geopolitical/regulatory risks ease.",
