    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium-high conviction. Multiple high-credibility sources (86-89% bullish across YouTube, RSS, X) converge on favorable macro positioning despite structural concerns in select sectors.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Institutional crypto adoption accelerating through wallet infrastructure and staking mechanisms, (2) Space sector momentum driven by privatization narratives and technology maturation, (3) Monetary easing tailwinds supporting risk assets amid competing fundamental deterioration signals, (4) AI/tech productivity narratives offsetting semiconductor supply-side vulnerabilities.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY resistance at $700 (STRONG), $695 (STRONG), $690 (STRONG) with support cluster at $555-$595 range. QQQ resistance at $640 (STRONG), $690 (STRONG), $630 (STRONG) with support at $605-$585. Silver March futures flagged as institutional positioning opportunity (no explicit price given). SPY Max Pain $670, QQQ Max Pain $625.",
