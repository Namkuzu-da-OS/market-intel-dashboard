    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter shows strong bullish momentum (78% bullish) anchored in tech strength and liquidity tailwinds, while RSS News reflects cautious skepticism (55% bullish) citing earnings misses and regulatory headwinds. YouTube analysts split optimistically on capex-driven cyclical upside but acknowledge policy-contingency risk. Professional trader data unavailable.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **AI Infrastructure Momentum** – mega-cap tech leadership narratives; (2) **Year-End Liquidity & Profit-Taking Dynamics** – thin holiday volumes creating amplified volatility in small/mid-caps vs. large-cap stability; (3) **Regulatory & Geopolitical Uncertainty** – regulatory enforcement actions and policy-dependent growth creating forward-looking risk offsetting rate-cut optimism; (4) **Sector Bifurcation** – defensives (utilities, tech on rate-cut appeal) outperforming vs. discretionary/financials/software under pressure.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** **SPY ($690.31):** Call Wall $700 (146k OI – active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI – dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% – active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6% – dormant). **QQQ ($623.89):** Call Wall $630 (33k OI – active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI – dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near support: $585 (137k OI, 6.2% – dormant). Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI – both active).",
