    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is **MIXED with bullish technical momentum offset by bearish fundamental concerns**—conviction: MEDIUM. Twitter and YouTube analysts lean bullish on near-term technicals and momentum, while RSS News emphasizes earnings deterioration and regulatory headwinds as the dominant near-term driver. The market is effectively split between those betting on technical continuation into early 2026 and those hedging equity exposure due to present-day corporate guidance cuts.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Precious metals and commodity momentum** as inflation/uncertainty hedge, with institutional capital rotation into tangible assets; (2) **Tech/AI narrative resilience** supporting index technicals despite software sector earnings concerns; (3) **Regulatory and earnings headwind uncertainty** creating defensive positioning (utilities, safe-haven flows) despite long-term Fed accommodation backdrop; (4) **Year-end liquidity and options expiry volatility** amplifying intraday swings and mean-reversion risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant support, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $625 (29k OI, active), $640 (31k OI, active). /ES support per Twitter: 6978.6 (cited as critical technical level). Crypto proxy levels per Twitter: $MSTR $150.6 capitulation test.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: Upside target $710–$750 on technical momentum (max pain $686 as gravitational pull). If $700 call wall is cleared, next resistance dormant at $730 (48k OI, 5.7% away). Downside: $670 (active support holds), breach below opens $645 dormant support (6.6% away). QQQ: Upside $630–$640 on momentum, with $625 as immediate resistance. Downside $590 put wall (5.4% away, dormant). 1–5 day bias favors upside into early January on technical setup, but with elevated liquidation risk from CME margin implementation and earnings concerns creating contained pullback risk.",
