    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates across all sources (75% weighted average) with medium-high conviction, driven by Fed rate-cut tailwinds and AI infrastructure momentum, though underlying distribution signals and earnings weakness suggest caution into 2026.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector structural adoption with semiconductor/infrastructure buildout as primary driver, (2) Fed monetary policy easing providing macro support despite corporate earnings concerns, (3) Platform security and institutional crypto adoption quality bifurcation creating selective opportunities.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI). VIX at yearly lows (13.77) supporting risk-on environment. /ES: 6847 support per Twitter analysis.",
