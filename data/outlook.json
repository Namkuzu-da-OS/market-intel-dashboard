    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is BULLISH with MEDIUM conviction. Mega-cap tech shows sustained momentum and new all-time highs, supported by AI monetization and monetary policy easing narratives. However, this strength is heavily concentrated in large-cap indices, masking significant weakness in mid-cap growth and crypto assets—suggesting bifurcated conviction rather than broad-based bull market.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and mega-cap tech momentum sustaining despite year-end liquidity constraints; (2) Monetary policy easing and rate-sensitive sector rotation favoring rate beneficiaries; (3) Bifurcated market structure—mega-cap strength masking mid-cap and crypto deterioration, with low holiday volume amplifying volatility.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—active hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—active).",
