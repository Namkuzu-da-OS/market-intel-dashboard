    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Cautiously bullish with medium conviction - sentiment ranges 65-100% bullish across sources, supported by Fed easing tailwinds and AI infrastructure narratives, but tempered by employment deterioration and earnings guidance cuts.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI productivity acceleration and enterprise adoption driving mega-cap tech consolidation, (2) Fed rate cut policy support versus supervisory tightening creating bifurcated sector performance, (3) Economic data deterioration (employment weakness, GDP deceleration) creating disconnect with equity valuations.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - ACTIVE). /ES: Twitter mentions 14-year USD lows and semiconductor sector weakness as technical watch points.",
