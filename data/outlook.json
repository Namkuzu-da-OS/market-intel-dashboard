    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Sources present a MIXED outlook with near-term bearish pressure but longer-term bullish potential. Conviction is MEDIUM—multiple tailwinds (Fed easing, AI productivity, infrastructure demand) compete with immediate headwinds (regulatory tightening, sector guidance misses, geopolitical uncertainty, momentum divergence).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Momentum Deterioration & Distribution Risk—breadth collapse (116 vs. 150+ stocks in bullish momentum) signals potential distribution despite all-time highs; (2) Regulatory & Earnings Headwinds—specific guidance cuts from software/fintech firms and enforcement actions creating near-term de-risking; (3) Precious Metals Exhaustion—silver's 182% YTD rally showing classic topping patterns with reversal already underway, testing support levels.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4%), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3%). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active at 2.9%), $645 (126k OI - dormant at 6.6%). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0%), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4%). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI - dormant at 6.2%). Silver reversal point: $79.30 per source; Bitcoin ascending triangle formation mentioned as key watch point per source analysis.",

Support deterioration would target $670 (active), then $645 (dormant, 6.6%), with major put wall support at $640. QQQ: Resistance at $630-$640 (active hedging); breakdown targets $590 put wall (164k OI) with further support at $585 (137k OI). 1-5 day horizon: expect testing of near-term support as precious metals exhaustion and momentum divergence play out; bullish reversal requires positive surprises on macro data.",
