    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets are split between near-term bullish momentum supported by rate-cut expectations and structural bearish concerns around earnings guidance deterioration, regulatory tightening, and elevated leverage. Conviction: MEDIUM—bullish technicals conflict with bearish fundamental deterioration.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Earnings guidance reset cycle masquerading as stabilization—fintech sector showing contagion risk to broader enterprise software; (2) Monetary easing tailwind vs. regulatory headwinds—Fed rate cuts supporting valuations but capital requirement tightening pressuring financials; (3) AI infrastructure demand structural support vs. leverage unwinding risk—genuine CapEx trends offset by crypto/options positioning vulnerabilities.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $625, $640 (both active). Per X sources, /ES 6550 cited as bear trigger level (attributed to Twitter analysis, not verified current price).",

    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: If call wall at $700 fails to break decisively, pullback toward $670 support and max pain $686 likely over 1-5 days. Breach below $670 would target dormant put wall at $640. QQQ: Tight range $625-$630 suggests consolidation; breakdown below $625 would test $590 put wall support over swing timeframe. Per RSS analysis, earnings guidance trends and regulatory announcements over next days will determine if downside bias materializes.",
