    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter sources show strong bullish bias (77%) anchored in mega-cap tech and AI momentum, while RSS News reveals structural bearish pressures (56% bullish) from guidance cuts, regulatory tightening, and margin compression. YouTube analysts are unanimously bullish on capex-driven growth, but this one-sided perspective limits stress-testing of the thesis. Professional trader data is unavailable for synthesis.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and mega-cap technology momentum offsetting broader corporate guidance weakness; (2) Monetary easing tailwinds vs. immediate operational headwinds (software spending cuts, regulatory capital pressures, pharmaceutical pricing constraints); (3) Year-end holiday liquidity thinness creating vulnerability in lower-confidence assets (mid-caps, crypto) despite strength in mega-cap indices; (4) Geopolitical uncertainty (China-Taiwan tensions, U.S. defense escalation) as unpriced tail risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.17): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - 1.4% away, ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - 7.3% away, dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% - ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.5% - dormant). QQQ ($624.39): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - 0.9% away, ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - 5.5% away, dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.5% - ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.1% - ACTIVE). Per Twitter: /ES support 6900-6940, resistance toward 7000. NVDA resistance $191-200 zone, ORCL breakout watch $200.",

QQQ: Tight range with resistance $625-630 (call walls, very active - 0.9-0.1% away). Support $620 max pain. Watch for breakout/breakdown of these tight bands; holiday liquidity suggests choppy, range-bound action.",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Bullish case targets $700 call wall breakdown toward $750 (8.7% away, dormant resistance). Put wall support at $640 (7.3%) provides downside protection over 1-5 day horizon. Key pivot: $687 max pain as gravitational center. QQQ: Similar structure—resistance $630-640 (call walls) vs. support $590 (5.5% away, put wall). If mega-cap momentum sustains (Twitter thesis), expect QQQ to test $640; SPY to test $700. If guidance weakness accelerates (RSS thesis), reversion toward max pain ($687/$620) likely within 3-5 days.",
