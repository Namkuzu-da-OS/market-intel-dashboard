Conviction is moderate-to-high on near-term upside, tempered by low-liquidity risk and geopolitical overhang.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI monetization and capital spending acceleration driving large-cap leadership; (2) Regulatory tightening and margin compression headwinds in financials/enterprise software; (3) Bifurcated market favoring policy-resistant sectors while constraining regulated industries.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—active), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant); Max Pain $687.
