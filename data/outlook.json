    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** NEUTRAL with MEDIUM conviction - market in consolidation mode as structural support from options positioning ($670 SPY put wall, $610 QQQ put wall) conflicts with weakening demand signals and elevated technical resistance.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Options dealer hedging creating defined trading ranges - active put walls providing downside support while call walls capping rallies. (2) Bifurcated market structure - crypto institutional adoption narratives versus technical deterioration, quality large-cap tech resilience versus cyclical/discretionary weakness. (3) Central bank policy uncertainty and liquidity withdrawal creating macro headwinds against forward-looking AI infrastructure and rate-cut structural tailwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.76): Call Wall $695 (7k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (13k OI, 1.7% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $690 (7k OI), $700 (6k OI). Near support: $680 (5k OI), $661 (9k OI). QQQ ($613.62): Call Wall $645 (26k OI, 5.1% away - dormant), Put Wall $610 (6k OI, 0.6% away - active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $635 (6k OI), $640 (6k OI). Near support: $585 (4k OI). Bitcoin: $93.5k-$94.5k rejection zone, $89k critical support per Twitter. Solana: $125 support per Twitter.",
