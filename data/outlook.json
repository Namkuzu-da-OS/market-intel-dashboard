    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium conviction (79% aggregate bullish sentiment). Market exhibits strong near-term momentum supported by seasonal flows and technical strength, but structural fiscal concerns and elevated complacency (VIX at 52-week lows) create asymmetric downside risk beyond the immediate window.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Santa Rally continuation momentum vs. fiscal sustainability concerns ($2.2T projected interest costs, $2T annual borrowing expectations creating medium-term headwinds), (2) AI productivity/institutional adoption tailwinds offsetting near-term sector-specific earnings headwinds in software and retail, (3) Fed rate policy expectations as primary catalyst uncertainty with FOMC divergence on timing creating bifurcated positioning between rate-sensitive growth and defensive rotation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - ACTIVE). VIX at 13.77 (52-week lows per Twitter - key complacency watch point).",
