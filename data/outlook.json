Bullish momentum from policy accommodation and institutional crypto adoption faces structural headwinds from earnings guidance cuts, negative equity risk premiums, and record leverage positioning.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Fed policy accommodation vs. fundamental deterioration - rate cut expectations supporting tactical bounces while corporate buyback blackouts remove mechanical support, (2) Institutional crypto adoption wave through banking partnerships and ETF launches creating sector rotation, (3) AI narrative exhaustion risks as leverage reaches extremes and geopolitical friction (chip restrictions) tests sustainability of tech momentum.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY: $685 resistance (strong OI wall), $680 support (strong OI wall); QQQ: $625 resistance (strong OI wall), $617 support (strong OI wall); AAPL: $330 price target mentioned in sources; SPY Max Pain at $670 as potential gravity zone.",
