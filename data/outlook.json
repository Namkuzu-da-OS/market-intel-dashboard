    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates (77% Twitter, 64% RSS, 100% YouTube, 80% Chat), but with medium conviction due to structural headwinds including technical deterioration at key moving averages, regulatory tightening, and sector-specific weakness in growth/crypto names.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Infrastructure maturation driving institutional crypto adoption and stablecoin payment rails; (2) M&A momentum with record deal sizes ($227M average, 68 deals >$10B) supporting small caps and semiconductors; (3) Year-end positioning mechanics creating bifurcation between defensive rotation and tactical accumulation in select sectors (TSM, NVDA, precious metals).\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.44): Call Wall $700 (106k OI, 2.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.1% away - dormant support). Max Pain $681. Near active support: $680 (69k OI, 0.8% away). QQQ ($617.79): Call Wall $620 (34k OI, 0.4% away - active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, 7.0% away - dormant). Max Pain $615. Near active resistance: $630 (33k OI, 2.0% away). /ES levels per Twitter: Weekly VWAP resistance being tested, 50-day moving average under pressure.",
