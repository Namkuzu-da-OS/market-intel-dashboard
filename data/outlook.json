    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with bearish structural headwinds outweighing bullish rotation narratives. Conviction is MEDIUM - sources acknowledge both near-term tactical bounce potential and underlying fundamental weakness.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) International equity rotation and precious metals momentum as capital flows away from underperforming US speculative assets; (2) Earnings disappointment risk in fintech and enterprise software creating gap between macro tailwinds and micro corporate guidance; (3) Geopolitical tail-risk (escalation rhetoric, policy uncertainty) as asymmetric threat to risk-on positioning; (4) Bifurcated market behavior with consolidation more likely than sustained directional conviction.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI - dormant 6.6% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active 2.6% away), $625 (29k OI - active 0.2% away). Both ETFs show bullish support bias with active hedging clustered near current prices.",

Max Pain $686 suggests oscillation range. QQQ: Resistance $630-$640 (active cluster), support $590 (dormant 5.4% away). Bias toward lower lows before sustainable recovery per Twitter bearish thesis (bearish higher timeframe trends intact, below yearly opening levels). Expect consolidation with tactical bounces rather than sustained rallies.",
