    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates across all sources (73-100% bullish readings), but bearish structural concerns create medium conviction - momentum faces valuation extremes and credit deterioration headwinds.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and technology sector leadership driving selective rotation, (2) Fed rate policy uncertainty with easing expectations supporting equities despite division signals, (3) Valuation extremes at record highs meeting historically low volatility creating late-cycle dynamics concern.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $730 (47k OI), $750 (55k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI, active). /ES: Watch Twitter-mentioned levels noting SPY confusion (SPY is dollars ~$680s, /ES is points ~6800s).",
