Bifurcated market dynamic where large-cap leadership masks mid-cap and breadth weakness.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI monetization and mega-cap tech dominance driving indices higher; (2) Fed easing cycle supporting growth valuations and rate-cut expectations; (3) Earnings disappointments and margin compression in software/financial sectors offsetting broad rally narrative; (4) Year-end liquidity drought and profit-taking in lower-quality equities amplifying drawdown risk; (5) Geopolitical uncertainty (U.S.-China tensions, Taiwan, Ukraine) as tail risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.88): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active, 1.3% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.4% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active, 3.0% away). QQQ ($624.86): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 0.8% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.6% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active, 2.4% away), $625 (29k OI - active, 0.0% away). /ES: 6900 technical support and 7000 target per Twitter sources.\",\n  \"source_alignment\": \"ALIGNED\",\n  \"conflicts\": \"None - sources aligned on core direction (bullish near-term with structural vulnerabilities). X and RSS both identify bifurcated market (tech strong, breadth weak) and acknowledge drawdown risk. Slight divergence in emphasis: X focuses more on technical breakdown risk and profit-taking; RSS emphasizes earnings/regulatory headwinds. Both conclude elevated volatility with upside bias remains most likely near-term outcome.\",\n  \"intraday_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"intraday_levels\": \"SPY: Resistance at $700 call wall (active hedging). Support at $670 (active support, 3% below). QQQ: Resistance at $630 call wall and $625 (both active). Support around $620 (max pain, near term). Watch for test of $700 on SPY or failure to hold $690 for intraday direction signal.\",\n  \"swing_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"swing_levels\": \"SPY: Call wall resistance $700 remains primary target (1-5 day horizon); if breached, $750 dormant resistance becomes relevant (8.6% away). Put wall support $640 (7.4% away) only activates on larger selloff. Max pain gravity $687 in effect through expiration. QQQ: Near-term range $620-$630 with call walls at both $630 and $625 capping upside; break above $630 would accelerate momentum.
