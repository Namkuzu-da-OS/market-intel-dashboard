    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets are navigating conflicting signals with cautious optimism dominating near-term sentiment (73% bullish in news, 63% bullish on X), but conviction remains medium due to underlying structural concerns and momentum divergences. Bullish positioning is concentrated in forward-looking narratives rather than broad confirmation.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Rate policy uncertainty and expectations for monetary accommodation driving tactical strength in growth/tech sectors; (2) Momentum divergence and breadth deterioration signaling potential exhaustion despite headline strength—only 116 stocks showing positive momentum vs. normal 150+; (3) Leverage and deleveraging dynamics in commodities (silver exhaustion at 182% YTD gains) and crypto positioning creating vulnerability to forced liquidations.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI - both active). Per X/Twitter: Bitcoin leverage support cited at $150-$156 levels on leveraged instruments; /ES futures mentioned in context of momentum breadth deterioration.",

    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Bullish structure supported by put wall at $640 (153k OI); path of least resistance toward $700 call wall if support holds. QQQ: Potential extension toward $640 (31k OI) if $625 resistance breaks; major support floor at $590 (164k OI - dormant until approached). Key risk: if either index closes below $670 (SPY) or $620 (QQQ), momentum deterioration thesis gains credibility and swing bias reverts to bearish.",
