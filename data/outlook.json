    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is mixed-to-bullish (68% bullish on Twitter, 57% on RSS, 100% from professional trader fetersynergy) but undermined by significant technical divergence and breadth warnings. Conviction is MEDIUM—bullish narratives on valuation and structural themes (AI, crypto strength, commodity supercycle) clash with bearish technical signals (silver exhaustion, momentum divergence, earnings headwinds).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Momentum Divergence & Breadth Failure** — S&P 500 at all-time highs but only 116 qualified momentum names vs. 150+ in healthy uptrends, signaling underlying weakness. (2) **Precious Metals & Crypto Strength** — Silver near record highs, Bitcoin above $90K, Ethereum above $3K, but silver showing exhaustion patterns (7/9 consecutive up days, -5% intraday reversals). (3) **Earnings Guidance Under Pressure** — Enterprise software, fintech, and discretionary sectors facing guidance cuts; near-term execution challenges weighing on growth stocks despite long-term AI tailwinds. (4) **Policy Uncertainty** — Rate-cut expectations, regulatory tightening in banking, and geopolitical tension (Ukraine, Taiwan) creating macro headwinds masked by surface-level index strength.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant until approached). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE). VIX: 13.60 (low volatility, complacency signals).",

Silver exhaustion signals and momentum divergence favor intraday pullback or consolidation.",
    "swing_bias": "NEUTRAL",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Swing structure supports $686-$700 consolidation range (max pain + call wall). If call wall ($700) holds, expect rotation toward put wall support ($640, 7.3% below) over 1-5 days. QQQ: Range $621-$640 likely over 1-5 days (max pain at $621, call wall at $630, near resistance at $640). Professional trader bullish conviction suggests any dips may find buying interest; breadth/earnings risk could limit upside. Watch silver for confirmation of bearish exhaustion thesis—breakdown would validate risk-off scenario; hold above recent support confirms commodity/crypto narrative.",
