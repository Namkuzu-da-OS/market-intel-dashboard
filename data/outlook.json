    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is broadly bullish (70-100% across sources) with moderate-to-high conviction, but bullish positioning appears technologically-driven rather than catalyst-driven. Bearish voices cite concrete technical exhaustion in commodities/crypto and earnings guidance cuts, creating tension between headline momentum and underlying breadth deterioration.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Rate policy expectations and monetary easing tailwinds supporting risk appetite; (2) AI productivity narratives and tech sector mean reversion competing with guidance cuts across enterprise software and financials; (3) Technical exhaustion in commodities and cryptocurrency with potential mean reversion; (4) Bifurcated market performance between AI-adjacent sectors and rate-sensitive cyclicals.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI – active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI – dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI – active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI – dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, active), $625 (29k OI, active).",
