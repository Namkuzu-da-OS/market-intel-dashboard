    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium conviction - sentiment is 80% bullish on X/Twitter andChat, 65-67% bullish across RSS/YouTube, supported by concrete capital deployments and seasonal tailwinds, but tempered by structural valuation warnings and regulatory uncertainties.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure dominance and mega-cap tech momentum driven by institutional capital commitments, (2) Monetary policy tailwinds with rate cut expectations supporting risk assets, (3) Sector bifurcation with geographic/regulatory divergence favoring U.S.-domiciled innovation over European exposure, (4) Housing structural recovery thesis based on supply deficits and credit easing.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.01): Call Wall $700 (144k OI, active resistance 1.9% away), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $688. Near active support: $680 (60k OI). QQQ ($619.43): Call Wall $620 (39k OI, immediate resistance 0.1% away), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $620. Near active resistance: $630 (32k OI). /ES levels per Twitter: monitoring for January seasonal strength in tech mega-caps.",
