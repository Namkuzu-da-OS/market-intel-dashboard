    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED conviction with bullish momentum narratives (62-100% bullish across sources) conflicting against bearish technical exhaustion signals and structural headwinds. Overall sentiment leans BULLISH on momentum but with MEDIUM-LOW conviction due to underlying weakness in breadth and earnings guidance.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Momentum exhaustion vs. continuation—consecutive up moves and breakouts face technical reversal signals; (2) Regulatory tightening and earnings revision risk masking headline strength; (3) Rate-cut expectations providing tactical support but questioned by concurrent macro headwinds and positioning extremes.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant support, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI—active), $645 (126k OI—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI—both active).",

QQQ: Resistance at $630 call wall and $625 (both active hedging zones). Intraday range likely contained by these active levels; breakout above $700 (SPY) or $630 (QQQ) would signal bullish conviction, while failure would test $670/$620 support.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: 5-day move targets $680 max pain as gravitational pull; failure to hold $700 call wall could accelerate toward $670 support (active), then $645 dormant put wall. Breakout above $700 would negate this, targeting $730-$750 dormant resistance. QQQ: Watch for breakdown below $625-$630 active resistance zone; failure here suggests swing toward $590 put wall support (dormant). Max pain at $621 suggests 1-5 day consolidation near current levels before directional break. Per source analysis: technical exhaustion and margin/liquidation catalysts favor corrective pullback over next 2-4 weeks.",
