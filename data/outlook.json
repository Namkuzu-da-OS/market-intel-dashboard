    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed sentiment with medium conviction - bullish structural tailwinds in AI/defense offset by near-term technical deterioration and household leverage concerns. Bifurcated market favoring quality over speculation.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure consolidation with focus on mega-cap tech dominance (NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT), (2) Institutional crypto adoption accelerating with regulatory clarity pathways creating quality bifurcation between tokenized systems vs non-token infrastructure, (3) Geopolitical supply-chain reshoring driving defense/domestic energy capital reallocation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.49): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, 8.8% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (149k OI - dormant). Max Pain $690. Near resistance: $693 (52k OI, 0.5% active), $701 (52k OI active). Near support: $680 (122k OI, 1.4% active). QQQ ($620.36): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, 3.3% away - active hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI - dormant). Max Pain $624. Near resistance: $627 (54k OI active), $630 (32k OI active). Near support: $610 (83k OI, 1.7% active). /ES per Twitter: Watch for volatility around tariff announcements.",
