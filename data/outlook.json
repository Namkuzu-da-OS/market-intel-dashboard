    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed bullish-neutral with medium conviction. Liquidity injection and gamma dynamics support near-term strength in mega-caps, but weak earnings guidance and consolidation patterns suggest fragility heading into year-end.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Treasury liquidity injection ($78B) and rate policy expectations driving rotation into rate-sensitive sectors, (2) AI infrastructure momentum and autonomous vehicle validation creating tech sector bifurcation, (3) Year-end tax-loss harvesting pressure versus gamma-driven squeeze dynamics in mega-cap options.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.35): Call Wall $688 (25k OI, 1.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (20k OI, 1.7% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $690 (25k OI), $685 (19k OI). Near support: $675 (11k OI), $661 (11k OI). QQQ ($612.65): Call Wall $621 (64k OI, 1.4% away - active resistance), Put Wall $610 (12k OI, 0.4% away - active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $624 (12k OI), $645 (27k OI dormant). Near support: $605 (9k OI), $600 (10k OI). /ES: 6847 support mentioned per Twitter analysis.",
