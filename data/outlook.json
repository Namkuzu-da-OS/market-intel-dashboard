    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed sentiment with medium conviction - bullish positioning in AI/tech sectors offset by near-term structural headwinds including supply chain constraints, regulatory tightening, and overbought technical conditions following 2025's rally.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum constrained by CoWoS chip packaging bottlenecks and supply chain physics, (2) Chinese tech sector strength and institutional capital rotation dynamics, (3) Regulatory framework developments creating tactical uncertainty across crypto and financial sectors, (4) Commodity mean reversion pressure following extended 2025 rally, (5) Low-volume volatility mechanics creating sector-level dispersion opportunities.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.92): Call Wall $750 (55k OI, resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, support). Max Pain $683. Near active resistance: $700 (49k OI), active support: $680 (77k OI). QQQ ($614.31): Call Wall $620 (38k OI, active resistance 0.9% away), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, support). Max Pain $615. Near active resistance: $625 (28k OI), $630 (34k OI). Brent crude $52 support level per Twitter analysis. /ES futures levels mentioned in social commentary but not specific prices quoted.",
