    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Sources show 64-100% bullish positioning on structural 2026 themes (AI, infrastructure, easing cycle), but near-term technicals and hedging patterns reveal material downside risks within 1-3 weeks. Consensus view favors tactical caution despite longer-term optimism.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/Robotics/Drones secular growth narrative anchoring 2026 bullish case; (2) Rate policy uncertainty and Fed easing trajectory as primary swing factor; (3) Earnings guidance deterioration and demand softness creating tactical hedging; (4) Precious metals/crypto parabolic reversal risk after 2025 peaks; (5) Geopolitical friction (Ukraine/Taiwan) as tail risk for risk-off flows.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($688.06): Call Wall $700 (150k OI, 1.7% - ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $630 (142k OI, 8.4% - dormant). Max Pain $689. Near support: $680 (60k OI, 1.2% - ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.3% - dormant). QQQ ($620.60): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.5% - ACTIVE), Put Wall $585 (137k OI, 5.7% - dormant). Max Pain $623. Near support: $590 (77k OI, 4.9% - ACTIVE). Per X (Twitter): Bitcoin $84.5K support critical for long positioning; /ES levels mentioned but source attribution only.",

Key breakpoint: Bitcoin $84.5K support per X—failure here suggests broader liquidation cascade triggering.
