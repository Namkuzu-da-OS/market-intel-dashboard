    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish structural narrative with near-term tactical caution - Medium/High conviction. Macro fundamentals (GDPNow +5.4%, productivity +4.9%) and sector-specific catalysts (healthcare/housing stimulus, crypto legislative clarity, CES tech momentum) support risk-on positioning, but immediate vulnerabilities exist from aggressive options hedging, financial sector technical deterioration, and elevated policy uncertainty. Market is in bifurcated state where strong fundamentals compete with fragile technicals.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/semiconductor dominance and supply chain reallocation favoring domestic tech, (2) Cryptocurrency regulatory clarity shifting institutional capital flows, (3) Macro strength vs. tactical positioning risk - heavy put hedging and short volatility exposure into options expiration creates near-term fragility, (4) Financial sector technical weakness as potential leading indicator for broader risk-off sentiment.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.51): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, resistance), Put Wall $630 (149k OI, support). Max Pain $688. Near resistance: $693 (52k OI), $701 (52k OI). Near support: $680 (126k OI). QQQ ($620.47): Call Wall $627 (57k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, support). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $630 (33k OI), $641 (55k OI). Near support: $590 (81k OI). /ES: Support at 6847 per Twitter sources. Apple technicals showing 7-day losing streak weakness; Bitcoin death cross noted as bearish signal.",
