    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish technical momentum in mega-cap tech and AI narratives compete against near-term headwinds from guidance deterioration, regulatory uncertainty, and shallow holiday liquidity. Risk-reward is balanced rather than directionally clear.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI and semiconductor sector momentum with elevated positioning, (2) Year-end/early-January liquidity vulnerability creating amplified volatility risk, (3) Guidance reset cycle and regulatory tightening creating tactical defensiveness despite structural bullish tailwinds, (4) Cryptocurrency leverage and forced liquidation risk offsetting recovery narratives.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near active support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near active resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.2% away), $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away). /ES: 6940 technical inflection per Twitter sources.",
