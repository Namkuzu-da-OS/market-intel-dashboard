    "narrative": "```json\n{\n  \"ai_narrative\": \"📊 **Consensus:** Markets show mixed conviction with a slight bullish lean in the near-term (large-cap tech momentum) contested by intermediate-term bearish pressure (earnings cuts, regulatory headwinds, geopolitical risk). Conviction is MEDIUM—bullish technicals are real but lack immediate catalysts; bearish macro concerns are concrete but lack confirmation of systemic breakdown.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Large-cap tech (particularly AI infrastructure) driving index performance amid structural capital spending cycles. (2) Mid-cap and broader market weakness signaling divergence—participation is narrowing despite headline index strength. (3) Holiday liquidity thinness amplifying volatility and profit-taking, with year-end positioning creating choppiness. (4) Regulatory/policy uncertainty and earnings revision risk as latent headwinds competing with monetary easing tailwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.82): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.5% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant, 7.2% away). Max Pain $687. Critical near-support: $670 (45k OI—active). QQQ ($623.99): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near-resistance: $640, $625 (both active). Per Twitter sources: /ES referenced at 6940 resistance and 6900 support (attributed as futures levels, distinct from SPY dollar-based structure).\",\n  \"source_alignment\": \"MIXED\",\n  \"conflicts\": \"X/Twitter (77% bullish) emphasizes near-term technical strength (SPX 7000 target, NVDA double-bottom, large-cap momentum) and thin-liquidity upside moves. RSS News (61% bullish) emphasizes mid-term bearish pressure—regulatory tightening, earnings cuts, geopolitical tail-risk—and portrays current rally as 'relief contested by reality.' YouTube (100% bullish on provided commentary) highlights capital spending acceleration and multiplier effects without presenting counterarguments. Professional Trader (20% bullish, 80% bearish positioning) lacks specific messaging but weighting suggests caution. Conflict: Twitter sees immediate strength; RSS News sees intermediate weakness and range-bound chop. This suggests intraday bullish bias vs. swing bearish bias—a tactical divergence where short-term momentum can persist despite longer-term headwinds.\",\n  \"intraday_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"intraday_levels\": \"SPY: Resistance at $700 (active Call Wall, 146k OI). Support at $670 (active Put Wall, 45k OI). QQQ: Resistance at $630 (active Call Wall, 33k OI) and $625 (active, 29k OI). Support zone $620 (Max Pain, gravitational pull). Watch for dealer hedging activation at these active levels—breakout above $700 SPY or $630 QQQ would signal continuation; failure to hold $670 SPY or $625 QQQ would trigger dormant support/resistance further down.\",\n  \"swing_bias\": \"BEARISH\",\n  \"swing_levels\": \"SPY: Dormant resistance at $730 (48k OI, 5.8% away) and $750 (55k OI, 8.7% away) create headwinds if momentum extends; critical support dormant at $645 (126k OI, 6.5% away) and Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.2% away). A 1-5 day pullback would likely target $670 (active) down to $645–$640 zone. QQQ: Dormant support at $585 (137k OI, 6.2% away) is the swing-trade downside target if momentum breaks. The combination of active resistance near current prices and dormant support below signals a swing-bias trade into weakness rather than strength.\",\n  \"key_tickers\": [\n    \"SPY\",\n    \"QQQ\",\n    \"NVDA\",\n    \"ORCL\",\n    \"IWM\"\n  ],\n  \"key_themes\": [\n    \"Large-cap AI infrastructure momentum vs. mid-cap weakness divergence\",\n    \"Holiday liquidity thinness and year-end profit-taking volatility\",\n    \"Regulatory/policy uncertainty and earnings revision headwinds\",\n    \"Capital spending cycle acceleration and productivity narrative\",\n    \"Geopolitical tail-risk (Taiwan, Ukraine) and macro uncertainty\"\n  ],\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Mid-cap and broader market rollover despite index strength—participation risk\",\n    \"Earnings revision acceleration across enterprise software and fintech sectors\",\n    \"Geopolitical escalation (Taiwan defense, Ukraine) as latent catalyst for risk-off repricing\",\n    \"Year-end liquidity evaporation creating exaggerated moves and whipsaw trades\",\n    \"Policy implementation delays or conflicting Fed messaging undermining easing cycle credibility\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
