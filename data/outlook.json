    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bearish with medium-high conviction. Structural deterioration (forced liquidations, technical rejections, guidance cuts) outweighs tactical bullish signals (AI tailwinds, Fed dovishness, oversold bounces).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Technical support failure cascade across multiple indices with distribution patterns, (2) Corporate earnings quality concerns as software/retail guidance cuts contradict AI-driven optimism, (3) Labor market deterioration as primary macro risk despite accommodative Fed policy, (4) Credit tightening signals emerging in micro-caps and datacenter financing exposure.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($672.62): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, 1.2% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (9k OI, 0.4% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $669 (7k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($602.13): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, 2.1% away), Put Wall $595 (7k OI, 1.2% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $613 (11k OI), $610 (10k OI).
