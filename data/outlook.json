    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets are consolidating with a cautious bullish structural bias, but near-term headwinds from year-end liquidity constraints and earnings reality checks are creating tactical weakness. Conviction is **medium** — the bullish case (Fed accommodation, AI capex acceleration, institutional accumulation) provides a floor, but bearish signals (guidance cuts, regulatory enforcement, crowded positioning in crypto/small caps) limit upside velocity.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Fed Accommodation Narrative** — monetary easing driving risk-asset re-rating, but sustainability questioned by earnings misses. (2) **AI/Capex Productivity Thesis** — capital expenditure acceleration in tech and infrastructure sectors positioning for 2026 upside, though near-term spending data validation remains pending. (3) **Year-End Liquidity Dysfunction** — holiday consolidation in crypto, small caps (IWM weakness), and risk assets creating tactical consolidation rather than directional breakout; institutional conviction measured.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Near-term support: $670 (45k OI - active). Max Pain $687. QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Near-term resistance: $625 (29k OI - active). Max Pain $620. Per Twitter: /ES consolidating with institutional positioning mixed; crypto (Bitcoin, Ethereum) showing weakness despite accumulation claims.",

QQQ: $625 and $630 are tightly clustered resistance zones (active hedging); support at $590 is dormant (5.4% away).

QQQ 5-day: Support at $590 (164k put OI, dormant but critical); resistance at $625-$640 zone. Max Pain gravity ($687 SPY, $620 QQQ) suggests consolidation bias into expiration. Bullish bias reflects Fed accommodation narrative and capex thesis providing structural support; bearish risk if guidance misses accelerate or geopolitical tensions spike.",
