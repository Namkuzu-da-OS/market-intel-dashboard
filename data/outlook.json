    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed near-term sentiment with bullish positioning dominating retail flows (74-80% bullish across sources) but bearish structural evidence gaining weight - medium conviction on tactical year-end strength masking fundamental deterioration.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure adoption and mega-cap tech momentum driving headline strength while masking sector divergence, (2) Rate policy tailwinds and monetary easing expectations supporting relief rally dynamics, (3) Structural demand destruction signals (heavy truck sales at 2020 lows, consumer weakness) creating fragile rally environment vulnerable to earnings season reality checks.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $730 (47k OI), $750 (55k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - active). /ES: Twitter mentions USD at 14-year support, silver technical breakdown pressure, ZEC critical support levels.",
