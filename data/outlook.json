    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market exhibits bifurcated sentiment with moderate conviction. Bullish structural narratives (AI capex, rate-cut expectations, deregulation) compete with near-term bearish pressures (earnings guidance cuts, geopolitical escalation, record debt levels). Overall bias is cautiously bullish near-term with elevated tail risks.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum and capex acceleration driving technology sector optionality; (2) Rate-cut expectations and accommodative policy supporting risk appetite; (3) Sector fragmentation—defensive rotation (utilities, treasuries) versus selective AI/tech exposure; (4) Geopolitical risk-off sentiment and supply-chain vulnerabilities; (5) Precious metals strength signaling safe-haven demand and potential inflation expectations.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0%—active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4%—dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—active). Per Twitter sources: /ES noted 6550 as explicit bearish trigger with downside targets 5500–5100 if broken.",

QQQ: Watch $625–$630 call wall cluster (active resistance, <1% away); support at $620 (near max pain). Intraday bias supported by bullish sentiment across 3 of 4 sources and active call wall positioning suggesting dealer hedge activity.",
    "swing_bias": "NEUTRAL_BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: $750 and $730 are dormant call walls (5.7–8.6% away) that activate if price sustains above $700. $645–$670 range marks active/dormant support zone—break of $645 targets dormant put wall at $640. QQQ: $640 call wall (active, 2.6% away) is immediate resistance; break targets $650+ (dormant levels). Below $620 targets $590 put wall (164k OI—significant support). 1–5 day outlook: Expect consolidation in $690–$700 range (SPY) or $623–$630 range (QQQ) with tactical breakout attempts. RSS bearish near-term guidance suggests weakness more probable than immediate breakout, but options structure (bullish put walls) implies dealer positioning for support.",
