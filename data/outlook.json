    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is broadly BULLISH with MEDIUM-HIGH conviction, supported by structural themes (AI infrastructure, commodity super-cycle, monetary easing expectations) and strong technical positioning in mega-cap tech. However, underlying divergences—sentiment deterioration in crypto despite price strength, silver exhaustion signals, and earnings momentum questions—suggest near-term consolidation risk rather than continued straight-line rally.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI and automation sector revaluation driving mega-cap tech momentum; (2) Reflation narrative and commodity strength (copper at all-time highs) supporting cyclical rotation; (3) Crypto momentum (BTC >$90K, ETH >$3K) with sentiment divergence suggesting potential distribution; (4) Regulatory uncertainty and earnings quality concerns creating tactical headwinds despite structural bullish case.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (150k OI, 1.4% away - ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $630 (142k OI, 8.7% away - dormant). Max Pain $689. Near support: $680 (60k OI, active), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away - ACTIVE), Put Wall $585 (137k OI, 6.2% away - dormant). Max Pain $623. Near resistance: $640 (60k OI combined, 2.6% away). Per Twitter sources: Silver technical breakdown at key support levels as primary near-term flashpoint; /ES support/resistance mentioned in bearish analysis warrant confirmation.",

QQQ: Resistance $630-$640 (active call walls); support $590-$585 (dormant put wall at 6.2% away). Most likely 1-5 day scenario: Consolidation with mild downside pressure; silver technical breakdown likely precedes broader equity retracement if exhaustion thesis activates.",
