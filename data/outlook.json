    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market is broadly bullish with medium-to-high conviction, supported by mega-cap technical strength and AI narrative momentum, but underlying breadth concerns and bifurcated leadership (large-cap outperformance vs. mid-cap weakness) create elevated reversal risk in low-volume conditions.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and capex-driven growth cycle sustaining mega-cap leadership; (2) Rate accommodation expectations supporting equities amid narrow participation; (3) Geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty creating sector rotation and demand deterioration risks; (4) Year-end liquidity dynamics and low-volume trading potentially amplifying volatility around technical levels.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE). Per Twitter: /ES major support at 6900 with resistance targets progressing 6940→7000.",

QQQ: Primary support $590 (put wall 164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant), resistance $630-640 band (active hedging). Max Pain gravitational pull: SPY $687, QQQ $620.
