    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium-low conviction - bullish technical themes clash with structural macro headwinds. Twitter shows 69% bullish on near-term earnings/AI momentum, but RSS news (65% bullish) and YouTube (86% bullish) note rising unemployment and regulatory tightening, while professional trader is 0% bullish (9 bearish messages).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure dominance and tech earnings strength driving near-term momentum, (2) Labor market deterioration and rising unemployment becoming primary macro driver over inflation, (3) Pre-election cycle volatility and Fed policy uncertainty creating tactical defensiveness despite secular growth narratives.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($673.83): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, 1.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (9k OI, 0.6% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $669 (7k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($603.65): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, 1.9% away), Put Wall $595 (7k OI, 1.4% away).
