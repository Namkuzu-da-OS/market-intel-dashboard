    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish bias with medium-to-high conviction. S&P 500 futures establishing new all-time highs, mega-cap tech strength (NVDA, MSFT, META, ORCL) driving year-end rally narrative, and Fed easing supporting risk assets. However, structural weakness in small-caps ($IWM), cryptocurrency pressure ($BTC down 7% YTD), and thin holiday volume create concentration risk and tail downside if liquidity normalizes sharply.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure monetization and mega-cap tech dominance; (2) Monetary accommodation supporting risk assets despite geopolitical hedging via precious metals; (3) Sector rotation favoring AI-ready technology and utilities over cyclicals, banking, and regulated financials; (4) Year-end consolidation with elevated tail risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.68): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($624.37): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active), $625 (29k OI - active). /ES: 6940+ support per Twitter social sentiment.",
