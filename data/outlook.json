    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment with medium conviction - broad market hitting new all-time highs with strong breadth, but structural headwinds (employment weakness, crypto outflows, financial sector technical breakdowns) create asymmetric downside vulnerability. Market trading on competing narratives where sentiment leaders diverge from emerging stress signals.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum and institutional adoption driving tech leadership, (2) Crypto regulatory clarity timeline and mainstream brand integration offsetting institutional outflow concerns, (3) Financial sector technical deterioration and banking system pressures creating sector-specific weakness that could spread.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($693.50): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, 8.1% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (149k OI, 9.2% away - dormant). Max Pain $688. Near resistance: $701 (52k OI, 1.1% - ACTIVE), $730 (48k OI). Near support: $680 (126k OI, 1.9% - ACTIVE), $640 (101k OI). QQQ ($625.61): Call Wall $627 (57k OI, 0.2% away - active hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $641 (55k OI), $650 (42k OI). Net positioning shows BULLISH_SUPPORT structure across both indices.",
