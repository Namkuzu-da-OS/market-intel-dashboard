Max Pain $687. Active resistance: $693 (48k OI, 0.2% away). Active support: $680 (85k OI, 1.7% away). QQQ ($623.42): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, 2.8% away - active hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, support). Max Pain $618. Active resistance: $627 (53k OI), $630 (33k OI). /ES: 6900 support and 7000 upside target per Twitter; NDX triangle breakout/breakdown pivot per Twitter.",
