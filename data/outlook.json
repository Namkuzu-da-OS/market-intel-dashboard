    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed conviction with structural conflict between bullish sentiment (66% Twitter, 100% professional trader, 55% news) and bearish technical evidence. Overall bias is cautiously bullish in the near term, but with medium-to-low confidence due to deteriorating breadth and momentum divergence.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Fed rate-cut expectations and monetary easing supporting risk-on positioning; (2) AI productivity narrative resilience as foundational support for tech mega-caps; (3) Precious metals exhaustion and retail leverage unwinding creating correction risks; (4) Market breadth deterioration masking strength in concentrated names—internal participation weakness despite S&P 500 ATHs.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI - active). Per Twitter analysis: /ES showing momentum breadth weakness with only 116 qualified names vs. 150+ expected; Silver at overbought extremes with $79.30 support critical; Bitcoin proxy MSTR at $150.60 support signaling crypto sector health.",

QQQ: $630 call wall resistance with $625 near-term pivot; if broken, $590 put wall (164k OI) provides structural support 5.4% below. Per Twitter: Silver $79.30 support critical—breach would validate bearish exhaustion thesis and trigger broader commodity/leveraged position unwind.
