    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is decidedly BULLISH with MEDIUM-HIGH conviction across the majority of sources. Large-cap tech and AI momentum are driving all-time highs, though breadth concerns (mid-cap weakness) and fundamental disconnects (earnings guidance cuts vs. bullish headlines) temper conviction. Near-term upside is more probable than downside, but rally quality is narrowing.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector dominance and large-cap tech strength as primary rally driver; (2) Fed rate-cut expectations and soft-landing narrative supporting risk-on positioning; (3) Breadth divergence (large-cap strength vs. mid-cap selling) signaling potential low-conviction rally; (4) Post-holiday liquidity normalization as a tactical wildcard; (5) Earnings guidance reliability as a near-term credibility test for sustained upside.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.08): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - ACTIVE, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - DORMANT, 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - ACTIVE, 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI - DORMANT, 6.5% away). QQQ ($624.21): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - ACTIVE, 0.9% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - DORMANT, 5.5% away). Max Pain $620. Near support: $585 (137k OI - DORMANT, 6.3% away), $640 (31k OI - ACTIVE, 2.5% away). /ES: Progression targets 6940-6960-6970-7000 per Twitter analysis.",
