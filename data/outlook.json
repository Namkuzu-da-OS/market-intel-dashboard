    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets face a genuine bull-bear tug-of-war with **MIXED conviction (medium)**. Bullish sentiment dominates social and analyst commentary (60-100% bullish across sources), yet structural bearish fundamentals (housing deterioration, Treasury dysfunction, guidance cuts, geopolitical risk) present empirically stronger near-term headwinds. The consensus emerging across sources is a tactical bounce scenario followed by renewed selling pressure—a \"sell-the-rip\" environment where initial enthusiasm encounters deteriorating fundamentals.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Monetary accommodation vs. earnings weakness** — rate-cut optimism colliding with cascading guidance cuts and demand deterioration across enterprise software, fintech, and financials; (2) **Defensive capital rotation** — precious metals and safe-haven flows outpacing speculative assets, signaling institutional risk-off positioning despite bullish headline sentiment; (3) **Sector-specific fragility** — AI/growth names at froth levels while housing, consumer spending, and trade fundamentals show structural deterioration; (4) **Treasury and credit stress** — delivery fails and volatility suggesting systemic dysfunction beyond fixed income.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE). VIX at 13.60 reflects suppressed volatility amid positioning fragility.",

Max Pain $686 provides gravitational pull. QQQ: Highly compressed—resistance cluster at $625-$630 (both ACTIVE: 29k + 33k OI). Any break above $630 faces dormant resistance $640 (31k OI). Support at max pain $621 with next level at $590 (164k OI, dormant). **Watch:** Bullish momentum may test $700 SPY / $630 QQQ, but breadth deterioration and dealer hedging at these walls likely cap rallies. Intraday whipsaw risk remains elevated.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Break below active support $670 targets dormant levels $645 (126k OI, 6.6% below price)—this is major consolidation zone. Put Wall at $640 (153k OI) becomes critical hold; breach opens door to $600s. Resistance: $700 Call Wall is hard ceiling for 1-3 day moves unless broad market relief. QQQ: Tighter range—$625-$630 band is noise. Real swing levels: resistance $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away), support $590 (164k OI, dormant—requires 5.4% move to activate). Precious metals strength (per YouTube analyst) suggests defensive rotations continue, supporting downside pressure on growth/cyclicals over next 1-5 days. Twitter's \"sideways-to-down bias over 1-3 months\" aligns with swing bearish outlook.",
