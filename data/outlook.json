    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Medium bearish conviction on near-term price action. Technical breakdown (QQQ 5-day losing streak, institutional selling) outweighs forward-looking bullish catalysts (regulatory tailwinds, consolidation patterns). However, sector rotation rather than capitulation suggests tactical bounces likely.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Tech mega-cap vulnerability with sector rotation into selective semiconductors and crypto infrastructure, (2) Regulatory clarity expectations driving blockchain/crypto sentiment divergence, (3) Institutional distribution patterns creating resistance at elevated levels while tactical setups persist.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($683.17): Call Wall $750 (55k OI, dormant), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, dormant). Max Pain $683. Near support: $680 (77k OI, active). Near resistance: $700 (49k OI, active). QQQ ($613.12): Call Wall $620 (38k OI, active), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, dormant). Max Pain $615. Near resistance: $625 (28k OI, active), $630 (34k OI, active). Near support: $590 (78k OI, active). /ES: 6872 support tested twice (per Twitter), lower targets 6854, 6838 if breakdown occurs.",
