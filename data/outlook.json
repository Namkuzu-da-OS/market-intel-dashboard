    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed sentiment with bullish technical structure overshadowed by fundamental deterioration - conviction MEDIUM. Twitter, YouTube, and RSS show 73-91% bullish positioning, but underlying narratives reveal significant consumer weakness and policy uncertainty creating fragile rally conditions.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Consumer confidence deterioration (89.1 vs 91.0 est, Present Situation 126.9→116.8) challenging equity valuations despite technical strength; (2) Fed policy credibility concerns creating bond market uncertainty; (3) Precious metals breakouts to ATHs signaling potential defensive rotation rather than inflation-driven strength; (4) Software/retail guidance cuts indicating demand deterioration across cyclical sectors.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - active). /ES: 6847 support per Twitter analysis.",
