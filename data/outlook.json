    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates across all sources (81% X, 65% RSS, 100% YouTube, 100% Professional) with medium conviction - structural optimism around AI productivity and monetary easing offset by concrete earnings deterioration and Fed hawkishness concerns.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure acceleration driving tech sector momentum with institutional accumulation, (2) Rate policy uncertainty as Fed cut odds collapse creating tension between policy optimism and monetary reality, (3) Structural economic headwinds including demographic pressures and wage suppression challenging reflation narratives.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($684): Max Pain $684.00. QQQ ($619): Max Pain $619.00. Options structure data limited - watch these Max Pain levels as gravitational pulls. /ES levels per Twitter: consolidation with tactical upside bias testing recent highs. Netflix testing 200-day MA cited as tech sector health indicator.",
