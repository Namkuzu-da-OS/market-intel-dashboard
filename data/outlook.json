    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed/neutral sentiment with medium conviction. Twitter shows 72% bullish retail optimism while professional sources show 50% bullish readings, suggesting retail enthusiasm not matched by experienced traders. Underlying tension between technical deterioration and fundamental optimism.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Crypto infrastructure evolution vs. macro headwinds - exchange innovation narratives conflicting with rate policy constraints and retail capitulation signals. (2) Tech/AI sector valuation concerns - extreme multiples and guidance cuts creating reassessment pressure despite long-term structural tailwinds. (3) Holiday liquidity conditions approaching - thin trading environments amplifying technical breakdown risks.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.76): Call Wall $695 (7k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (13k OI, 1.7% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $690 (7k OI), $700 (6k OI). Near support: $680 (5k OI), $661 (9k OI). QQQ ($613.62): Call Wall $645 (26k OI, 5.1% away - dormant), Put Wall $610 (6k OI, 0.6% away - active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $635 (6k OI), $640 (6k OI). Near support: $605 (4k OI). /ES: 6847 support referenced per Twitter. Crypto: BTC rejection at $93.5k-$94.5k resistance, $89k support; SOL testing $125 support with $80 downside target per Twitter analysis.",
