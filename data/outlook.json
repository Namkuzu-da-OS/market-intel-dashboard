Conviction: MEDIUM.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Fed rate-cut expectations and monetary policy tailwinds driving mega-cap tech leadership; (2) AI adoption acceleration and capital expenditure cycle potential offsetting earnings quality concerns; (3) Holiday liquidity constraints creating bifurcated market behavior—strength in mega-cap positioning paired with systematic liquidation in mid-cap growth and cryptocurrency volatility.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.53): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.5% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.2% away). Max Pain $687. Near resistance: $730 (48k OI, dormant), $750 (55k OI, dormant). Near support: $670 (45k OI, active), $645 (126k OI, dormant). | QQQ ($623.75): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $620.

RSS and YouTube maintain bullish bias but acknowledge embedded hedging and valuation concerns. The disconnect suggests consensus optimism masks institutional hedging and distribution in growth assets—a classic Druckenmiller divergence signal (positive sentiment + weak technicals). This bifurcation likely persists through year-end holiday liquidity.\",\n  \"intraday_bias\": \"NEUTRAL\",\n  \"intraday_levels\": \"SPY: Immediate resistance at $700 (active call wall with 146k OI), support at $670 (active put wall). QQQ: Immediate resistance $625-$630 (active hedging zone), support at $590 (dormant but high 164k OI). Watch for breakout/breakdown rather than directional commitment given holiday liquidity constraints.\",\n  \"swing_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"swing_levels\": \"SPY swing target: $710-$730 if breaks above $700 call wall (dormant resistance at $750 becomes next target, 55k OI). QQQ swing target: $630-$640 if breaks through active resistance zone. Retest support: SPY $670-$645 if pullback occurs (dormant put wall at $640 provides structural floor).
