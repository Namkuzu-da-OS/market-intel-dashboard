    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter sentiment runs 57% bullish but with strong bearish structural arguments; RSS News leans 73% bullish but emphasizes near-term execution risk; YouTube analysts show 100% bullish on precious metals but lack breadth. Professional trader data unavailable. Overall: cautiously bullish on longer-term themes, but significant near-term headwinds acknowledged across sources.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Earnings quality deterioration and guidance revision risk in enterprise software and fintech sectors creating execution uncertainty; (2) Capital rotation into safe-haven assets (precious metals, hard assets) signaling risk-off positioning despite headline equity bullishness; (3) Regulatory tightening and policy uncertainty creating divergence between institutional conviction and near-term trading opportunities; (4) Geopolitical risk premium embedded in positioning with binary tail-risk potential for resolution or escalation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). | QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), $640 (31k OI - active at 2.6% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. | Per Twitter: /ES_F support at $6978.6 cited as critical test point for equity continuation.",

Upside capped by $700 call wall (146k OI) with resistance extending to $730/$750 if wall penetrated. QQQ: Consolidation between $625-$640 likely near-term; break below $625 toward $590 put wall (164k OI) would confirm swing bearish thesis. /ES_F $6978.6 (per Twitter) remains critical support test—breach signals momentum toward lower levels.",
