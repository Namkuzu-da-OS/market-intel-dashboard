Max Pain $681. Near support: $680 (69k OI, active 0.7% away), $640 (100k OI, dormant). Near resistance: $730 (48k OI), $750 (55k OI). QQQ ($617.42): Call Wall $620 (34k OI, active 0.4% away), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, dormant 6.9% away). Max Pain $615. Near support: $590 (78k OI, active), $580 (108k OI).
