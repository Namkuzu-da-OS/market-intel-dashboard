Conviction is MEDIUM—near-term support is active but fragile as fundamental cracks widen beneath the surface.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Large-cap tech/AI momentum sustaining despite breadth weakness in mid-caps and select enterprise software; (2) Rate-cut expectations and policy tailwinds supporting liquidity-driven rally, but regulatory/compliance headwinds emerging as offsetting drag; (3) Year-end low-volume consolidation dynamics creating choppiness with upside bias, yet vulnerable to profit-taking and positioning unwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support (active): $670 (45k OI, 2.9% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active hedging 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance (active): $625 (29k OI, 0.2% away), $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away).\",\n  \"source_alignment\": \"MIXED\",\n  \"conflicts\": \"X sentiment (77% bullish) and RSS narrative (54% bullish) diverge significantly on conviction and sustainability. X emphasizes technical/momentum strength toward 7000 SPX with broad mega-cap participation, while RSS flags earnings misses (Fiserv, Workday) and guidance cuts as warning signals. YouTube (50% bullish) splits the difference: acknowledging capex momentum but warning regulatory compliance costs erode gains. Professional trader (fetersynergy) shows 13% bullish—stark contrast indicating active trader positioning is far more cautious than retail/institutional narratives. This divergence signals: mainstream consensus is bullish but professional positioning is defensive, creating potential for rapid narrative shift if breadth fails to confirm rally.\",\n  \"intraday_bias\": \"NEUTRAL\",\n  \"intraday_levels\": \"SPY: Watch $700 call wall for resistance (active hedging). $670 active support (2.9% below price). QQQ: $625 and $630 resistance zone (active). Break of $630 targets $640 per options structure. Support: $620 max pain acts as gravitational anchor.\",\n  \"swing_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"swing_levels\": \"SPY: Upside target $700 call wall, potential extension to $750 if call wall penetrates (currently dormant). Support holds at $670 (active) then $640 put wall (dormant, activates ~7% down). QQQ: Resistance $630-$640 zone; break targets $650+. Support: $620 max pain, then $590 put wall.
