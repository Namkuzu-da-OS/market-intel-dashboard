    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter shows strong bullish lean (80%), but RSS News reveals underlying weakness with 63% bullish and documented earnings misses offsetting macro optimism. The divergence suggests traders are bullish on forward narratives (stimulus, rate cuts, AI CapEx) while price action reflects present-tense headwinds (guidance cuts, regulatory friction, geopolitical risk).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Rate-cut expectations and monetary easing as primary bull narrative vs. macro fragility with record global debt levels ($346T) as primary bear narrative; (2) AI and productivity gains narrative conflicting with documented earnings guidance misses in software/fintech sectors; (3) Year-end positioning and sentiment extremes creating binary outcomes—either validation of bull case or correction trigger.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $625-$640 (active). Per Twitter: /ES bears cite 6550 as critical technical threshold with downside target toward 5500-5100 if breached.",
