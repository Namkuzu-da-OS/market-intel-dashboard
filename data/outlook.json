    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets exhibit MIXED sentiment with moderate conviction—bullish on crypto/commodities and longer-term structural themes (AI, rate easing), but bearish on near-term equity technicals and earnings visibility. Conviction: MEDIUM across all sources.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Institutional crypto inflows vs. liquidation cascade risk in tech assets; (2) Enterprise earnings deterioration (software guidance cuts) conflicting with Fed easing narrative; (3) Macro debt sustainability concerns vs. regulatory tailwinds for financial institutions; (4) Commodity/precious metals accumulation vs. equity technical breakdown warnings.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—ACTIVE hedging, 1.4% resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant support, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—ACTIVE, 1.0% resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, ACTIVE). Per Twitter analysis: /ES support at 6550 (bearish trigger threshold per trader commentary); commodities (Silver target $122 via 1.618 extension per technical analysis).",

Per Twitter technical analysis, /ES breakdown below 6550 opens 5500–5100 target zone over 1–5 days. QQQ: Resistance $640 (2.6% above); if broken, $650 area. Support at $590 put wall (5.4% below current) only activated on material selloff. Commodity targets: Silver $122 (per 1.618 extension); watch for precious metals to lead or confirm equity breakdown.",
