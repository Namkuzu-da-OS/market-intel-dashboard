Market facing tug-of-war between structural tailwinds (institutional crypto/AI adoption, wealth accumulation) and near-term vulnerabilities (year-end liquidity stress, regulatory headwinds, tech sector weakness).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Institutional capital migration into crypto/AI infrastructure as multi-year structural theme; (2) Year-end liquidity dynamics and repo market strain creating tactical volatility risk; (3) Tech sector leadership deterioration and regulatory pressure offsetting Fed dovishness.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY resistance at $690, $685, $684; support at $677, $680, $683. QQQ resistance at $630, $631, $634; support at $610, $620, $613. Bitcoin consolidation range $96K-$100K per Twitter sources.",
