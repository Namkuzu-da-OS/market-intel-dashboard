    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is bifurcated between bullish long-term narratives (regulatory clarity, institutional adoption, AI productivity gains) and bearish near-term pressure (post-holiday profit-taking, earnings misses, on-chain weakness). Overall conviction is MEDIUM—bullish thesis is forward-looking and catalyst-dependent, while bearish pressure is empirically present today.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Sector rotation away from rate-sensitive cyclicals toward AI/productivity winners and regulatory clarity beneficiaries; (2) Post-holiday liquidity crunch amplifying volatility in crypto, mid-caps, and energy; (3) Earnings quality divergence—technology/infrastructure capex strength offsetting financial/pharmaceutical guidance weakness; (4) Institutional adoption narratives (crypto, small-cap positioning) hinge on regulatory and macro validation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant support at 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—active), $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active). Per Twitter: /ES levels referenced around 6847 support area (attribute: trader sentiment chatter, not institutional data).",

Support at $590 (164k OI, dormant—requires larger move). Intraday bias favors testing $670 SPY support and $625 QQQ resistance due to active gamma hedging zones and post-holiday profit-taking pressure.",

Breach below $670 targets $645 (126k OI, 6.6% dormant support). QQQ swing range: $625 (active resistance) to $590 (dormant put wall). Max pain gravity at $687 (SPY) and $620 (QQQ) suggests range consolidation likely through expiration. Swing traders should monitor whether post-holiday volume return validates bullish breakout or confirms bearish breakdown.",
