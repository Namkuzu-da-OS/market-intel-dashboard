    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish momentum in mega-cap tech and crypto persists, but bearish structural warnings (breadth deterioration, precious metals exhaustion, earnings disappointment cascades) create near-term headwinds. Consensus narrative is 'AI enthusiasm meets execution caution'—conviction in long-term themes undermined by near-term profitability concerns.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI adoption and tech mega-cap leadership consolidation—sustained positive narrative despite valuation concerns. (2) Rate policy expectations and monetary stimulus—Fed easing viewed as valuation floor, but unclear trajectory creates uncertainty. (3) Breadth-momentum divergence and momentum exhaustion—S&P 500 at ATH but participation narrowing; precious metals showing reversal signals after exhaustion patterns. (4) Earnings execution risk—software and financial services guidance disappointments creating near-term pressure despite longer-term bullish catalysts.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant until approached at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI—both ACTIVE). Per Twitter analysis: Bitcoin holding above $90K and Ethereum above $3K as crypto durability tests; /ES consolidation with downside bias into early January per technical momentum exhaustion.",

      "Regulatory headwinds and enforcement announcements—financial services and fintech clarity could accelerate if authorities move on constraints beyond current pricing",

    "intraday_bias": "NEUTRAL",

QQQ: Testing $630 call wall and $625 resistance (both active hedging zones); support at $590 (dormant). Watch for consolidation around max pain levels ($686 SPY, $621 QQQ) with potential intraday breakout/breakdown if dealer hedging activates. Momentum exhaustion and breadth divergence suggest range-bound trading rather than directional thrust.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: If $700 call wall holds, watch for pullback toward max pain $686 and then $670 support (45k OI—active). Breakdown below $670 would test $645 (126k OI—dormant), representing 6.6% downside. QQQ: Resistance at $640 and $625 (both active); break below $625 would target $590 put wall (164k OI), representing 5.4% downside to that dormant support. Swing timeframe (1-5 days) favors BEARISH given momentum exhaustion signals (breadth failure, silver reversal exhaustion, consolidation bias into early January per technical analysis). Bitcoin and Ethereum levels per source: sustain above $90K and $3K respectively, or risk crypto selloff cascading into rate-sensitive tech.",
