    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium conviction - sources show 81% Twitter bullish, 71% RSS bullish, 100% YouTube bullish, supported by institutional crypto adoption, AI infrastructure momentum, and improving macro liquidity. Structural risks include job market deterioration (JOLTS miss), valuation extremes, and regulatory/geopolitical headwinds.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and semiconductor supply constraints driving selective tech strength, (2) Institutional cryptocurrency adoption with legislative tailwinds offsetting security/regulatory concerns, (3) Macro liquidity inflection from refinancing cycles and accommodative policy expectations against banking sector pressures.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($693.37): Call Wall $750 (55k OI, 8.2% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 9.1% away - dormant). Max Pain $690. Near resistance: $701 (51k OI - ACTIVE), $730 (48k OI - DORMANT). Near support: $680 (121k OI - ACTIVE), $640 (101k OI - DORMANT). QQQ ($627.03): Call Wall $641 (56k OI, 2.2% away - ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, 8.3% away - dormant). Max Pain $622. Near resistance: $650 (44k OI), $630 (31k OI). Net bias: BULLISH_SUPPORT for both. /ES: Multiple timeframe bullish signals per Twitter; all-time highs being tested.",
