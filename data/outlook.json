    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium-high conviction. Multiple sources converge on AI/semiconductor strength and institutional positioning, though tempered by structural macro risks (liquidity drains, global bond stress) that could trigger volatility.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure buildout pivoting toward memory/supply-constrained plays over flagship GPU names, (2) Regulatory clarity optimism in crypto/digital assets driving institutional adoption, (3) Liquidity withdrawal concerns (Treasury General Account drawdown, Japanese bond yields at multi-decade highs) creating macro fragility beneath bullish momentum.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($688.14): Call Wall $750 (55k OI, 9.0% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.4% away - dormant). Max Pain $687. Near resistance: $693 (48k OI, 0.7% - ACTIVE), $730 (48k OI). Near support: $680 (85k OI, 1.2% - ACTIVE). QQQ ($619.15): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, 3.5% away - active hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, 7.2% away). Max Pain $618. Near resistance: $627 (53k OI, 1.3% - ACTIVE), $620 (38k OI, 0.1% - ACTIVE). Twitter mentions: SPY $690 resistance ($1.7B call wall), /ES support levels per Twitter analysis.",
