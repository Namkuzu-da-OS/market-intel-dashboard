    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** BEARISH with MEDIUM conviction - technicals deteriorating with SPX breaking 50-day MA and first red trend day since late November, though strong earnings catalysts (Micron beat) and seasonal patterns create crosscurrents.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Technical breakdown vs earnings fundamentals tension - market structure showing bearish momentum while mega-cap earnings remain strong, (2) Fed policy uncertainty creating near-term volatility despite dovish 2026 expectations, (3) Labor market deterioration (4.6% unemployment) threatening soft-landing narrative that supports current valuations.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($672.33): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, 1.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (9k OI, 0.3% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $669 (7k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($601.71): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, 2.2% away), Put Wall $595 (7k OI, 1.1% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $610 (10k OI), $613 (11k OI). Near support: $600 (6k OI), $597 (5k OI). Twitter mentions: SPX support at 6789, resistance zone 6806-6818; TSLA support at 471.",
