    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish narratives dominate on AI/tech momentum and rate-cut tailwinds (60-100% bullish across X, RSS, YouTube, and professional sources), but bearish structural evidence—earnings deterioration, Treasury dysfunction, real estate weakness, and geopolitical tail risks—creates underlying fragility. Near-term consolidation with downside vulnerability is more probable than conviction upside.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI productivity disruption and mega-cap tech resilience driving sentiment; (2) Fed easing cycle and rate-cut expectations supporting cyclical recovery narrative; (3) Emerging markets and precious metals outperformance capturing capital rotation away from underperforming altcoins; (4) Earnings recession risk from cascading guidance cuts across fintech, software, and pharma offsetting rate optimism; (5) Systemic deleveraging pressure from Treasury delivery fails, real estate deterioration, and credit market stress building beneath low-volatility surface.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). | QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI, 6.2%—dormant). | /ES: 6,978.60 cited as resistance/support per Twitter sources.",

    "intraday_bias": "NEUTRAL",
    "intraday_levels": "SPY: Watch $700 call wall (active resistance, 1.4% away) for intraday cap. Support at $670 (active 2.9% level) acts as near-term floor. QQQ: $625-$630 zone represents compressed resistance (0.2-1.0% away, both ACTIVE). If breached, watch $640 (2.6% away). Intraday consolidation most probable; avoid conviction direction until levels break decisively.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Breakout above $700 call wall targets $730-$750 (5.7-8.6% away, dormant resistance). Breakdown below $670 support initiates move toward $645 then $640 put wall (6.6-7.3% away). Swing bias leans bearish because active call hedging at $700 should cap rallies, while accumulating structural deterioration (earnings, credit stress) favors lower prices over next 1-5 days. QQQ: $630 call wall is final resistance; $625 and $640 represent sequential resistance. Breakdown below $625 targets $590-$585 put wall (5.4-6.2% away). Max pain at $621 suggests week-end gravity toward that level.",
