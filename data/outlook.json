    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED conviction with a modest bullish bias in the near term, tempered by holiday illiquidity and year-end deleveraging risks. Conviction is MEDIUM—structural tailwinds (regulatory clarity, monetary easing, AI productivity) compete with tactical headwinds (low volume, forced liquidations, geopolitical friction).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Policy-driven cyclical expansion anchored on capital spending and deregulation tailwinds; (2) Monetary easing and credit availability supporting rate-sensitive sectors; (3) Year-end positioning volatility and forced liquidations creating tactical weakness into early January before structural bull case reasserts.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant support). Max Pain $687. Near-term support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant support). Max Pain $620. Near-term resistance: $625 (29k OI - active), $640 (31k OI - active).",

Put support floor at $590 (dormant, 5.4% away) acts as swing-trading target if selloff accelerates.",
