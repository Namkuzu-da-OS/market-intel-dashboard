    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed bullish sentiment with medium conviction. Sentiment indicators show 79% bullish on X/Twitter and 100% bullish from YouTube/professional sources, but structural concerns around monetary policy tightening and technical deterioration in mega-cap tech create friction against the optimistic narrative.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum and institutional adoption driving tech selectivity, (2) Monetary policy uncertainty with rate cut expectations collapsing creating valuation pressure, (3) Crypto institutional mainstreaming with regulatory normalization tailwinds, (4) Quality rotation within growth sectors away from fintech/enterprise software toward AI and autonomous vehicle exposure.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($684 Max Pain): Call Wall activity and Put Wall $555 (504k OI) showing heavy downside hedging. Max Pain $684. QQQ Max Pain $619. /ES: 6847 support per Twitter commentary. Netflix noted 18% below 200-day MA signaling tech weakness. Gold up 71% from 2024 lows per social commentary. Bitcoin $100K speculation (Polymarket 3% odds by year-end per Twitter).",
