Market facing tactical consolidation as earnings downgrades clash with rate-cut optimism while unemployment trends signal late-cycle dynamics.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector momentum and productivity narratives driving tech leadership despite commercialization timeline uncertainty, (2) Fed rate policy accommodation priced in but conflicting with supervisory capital tightening, (3) Structural debt dynamics and household wealth concentration at historical bear market peak levels creating hidden fragility.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($678.87): Call Wall $681 (17k OI), Put Wall $677 (11k OI). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $678 (10k OI), $675 (10k OI). QQQ ($611.75): Call Wall $615 (13k OI), Put Wall $610 (9k OI). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $613 (11k OI), $614 (8k OI). Near support: $609 (8k OI), $595 (7k OI). /ES: 6800/6764 range anchors, 50-day MA critical threshold, 6400-6350 downside targets per Twitter.",
