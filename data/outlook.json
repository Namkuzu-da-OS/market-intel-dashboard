    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Neutral with low conviction - market caught in structural bull narrative (institutional adoption, infrastructure innovation) versus tactical deterioration (technical rejections, thin holiday liquidity, leverage risks). Bearish technical signals outweigh forward-looking catalysts in near-term.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and institutional crypto adoption creating long-term structural tailwinds, (2) Technical breakdown risks across major indices testing critical support zones amid thin holiday liquidity, (3) Macro leverage concerns (AI-linked corporate debt, BOJ liquidation plans) threatening near-term stability despite extreme fear gauge readings.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.76): Call Wall $695 (7k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (13k OI, 1.7% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $690 (7k OI), $700 (6k OI). Near support: $680 (5k OI), $661 (9k OI). QQQ ($613.62): Call Wall $645 (26k OI, 5.1% away - dormant), Put Wall $610 (6k OI, 0.6% away - active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $635 (6k OI), $640 (6k OI). Near support: $585 (4k OI). /ES per Twitter: $6847 support mentioned, resistance zone $93.5k-$94.5k rejected.",
