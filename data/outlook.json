    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is predominantly bullish (79% bullish on X, 100% from professional traders, 58% on RSS) with medium-to-high conviction, though RSS news introduces structural headwinds (enterprise software weakness, regulatory tightening) that create near-term choppiness rather than outright bearish reversal. The bullish case rests on AI/tech infrastructure monetization and institutional capital flows, while bearish technical signals warn of weakening price action relative to positive headlines—a divergence historically associated with trend exhaustion.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and technology sector momentum as primary structural driver; (2) Enterprise spending weakness and earnings revision risk offsetting growth narratives; (3) Geopolitical uncertainty and regulatory headwinds creating near-term volatility drag; (4) Year-end derivative positioning unwinds and potential tactical pullbacks before sustained rallies.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.38): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active at 3.0%), $645 (126k OI - dormant at 6.6%). | QQQ ($623.93): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near support: $585 (137k OI - dormant at 6.2%). Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active at 2.6%), $625 (29k OI - active at 0.2%). Per Twitter: /ES 6900 support with 7000 bull target mentioned.",
