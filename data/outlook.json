    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with a bearish lean (60-100% bullish across sources, but RSS and X note strong structural headwinds masking tactical strength). Conviction is MEDIUM—bullish sources lack specific catalysts, while bearish case anchors in measurable macro deterioration and options positioning stress signals.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Macro deterioration vs. tactical relief** – homebuyer activity weakness, trade volume declines, and Treasury delivery stress compete with precious metals strength and sector rotation dynamics; (2) **Bifurcated market with defensive rotation** – growth/tech strength in specific pockets offset by financial services tightening, healthcare guidance cuts, and discretionary spending softness; (3) **Margin/volatility compression** – options expiry dynamics and commodity margin concerns creating near-term whipsaw risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI - dormant). /ES futures levels mentioned per X: 6978.6 (BAC support), 6847 (banking support threshold per Twitter analysis).",
