    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is mixed with bullish momentum in mega-cap tech and cryptocurrencies offset by emerging exhaustion signals and deteriorating breadth. Conviction is MEDIUM—near-term upside bias supported by narrative tailwinds, but mechanical weakness in positioning and commodity mean-reversion risks temper conviction.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI productivity and mega-cap tech strength consolidating gains rather than extending; (2) Cryptocurrency consolidation at psychological round-number resistance (Bitcoin $90K, Ethereum $3K); (3) Breadth deterioration and exhaustion signals in commodity rallies (silver volatility) suggesting late-cycle concentration; (4) Rate policy and geopolitical risk uncertainty creating hedging behavior despite bullish headlines.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI—active), $645 (126k OI—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI—active), $625 (29k OI—active). Per X: /ES support mentioned by traders; cryptocurrency resistance at round numbers ($90K BTC, $3K ETH) per sentiment data.",

QQQ: More constrained; $625-$630 represents tight consolidation zone; break above $630 opens path to $640, but put wall at $590 (164k OI) provides strong 5-day downside support if momentum reverses.
