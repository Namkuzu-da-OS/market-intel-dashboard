    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is cautiously bullish with medium conviction. Quantitative data shows strong bullish readings (73-100% across sources), but qualitative analysis reveals underlying concerns about technical weakness despite positive fundamentals, creating a bifurcated outlook.\n\n📈 **Themes:** 1) AI sector momentum remains dominant with focus on revenue sustainability and sector rotation potential. 2) Rate policy uncertainty as Fed rate cut expectations have compressed significantly, creating headwinds for growth stocks. 3) Sector fragmentation with tech/utilities attracting capital while financials and software face defensive repositioning.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.38): Call Wall $700 (150k OI, 1.4% away - ACTIVE resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away - dormant). Max Pain $684. Near support: $650 (41k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($623.93): Call Wall $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away - ACTIVE), near resistance $630 (30k OI - ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $617.",
