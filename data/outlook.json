Sources identify structural headwinds (consumer debt at 30% of disposable income, regulatory enforcement, technical deterioration) that are materializing now, while bullish catalysts remain forward-looking and contingent on policy shifts that haven't materialized.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Consumer debt stress constraining spending power at levels not seen since 2008, (2) Regulatory uncertainty creating volatility across crypto and tech sectors, (3) AI infrastructure narrative maintaining institutional support but facing valuation compression risk, (4) Technical deterioration in mega-cap tech and crypto signaling momentum shift.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($688.89): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, resistance), Put Wall $630 (149k OI, support). Max Pain $690. Near resistance: $693 (52k OI), $701 (52k OI). Near support: $680 (122k OI, active). QQQ ($619.28): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, support). Max Pain $624. Near resistance: $627 (54k OI), $620 (35k OI). Near support: $610 (83k OI, active). /ES: tariff decision flagged as volatility trigger per Twitter analysis.",
