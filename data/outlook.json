    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed sentiment with medium conviction - sources show 61-77% bullish readings, but structural tailwinds (macro strength, policy stimulus) face near-term tactical headwinds from technical deterioration, elevated hedging activity, and regulatory pressures across crypto/tech sectors.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum vs. mega-cap technical breakdown - leadership bifurcation between semiconductor/autonomous driving strength and Apple/mega-cap weakness; (2) Crypto sector fragmentation - institutional adoption/regulatory clarity vs. security breaches and governance token stagnation; (3) Macro policy support (trade deficit improvements, GDP growth potential) colliding with consumer debt stress and Treasury yield pressures.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.51): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, 8.8% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (149k OI, 8.6% away - dormant). Max Pain $688. Near resistance: $693 (52k OI, active), $701 (52k OI, active). Near support: $680 (126k OI, active). QQQ ($620.47): Call Wall $627 (57k OI, 1.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, 7.4% away - dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $630 (33k OI), $641 (55k OI). Near support: $590 (81k OI, active). /ES: 6847 support per Twitter. Bitcoin: $60,000 support level per Twitter sentiment analysis.",
