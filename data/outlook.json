    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show mixed conviction with a slight bullish lean supported by Fed easing expectations and AI narratives, but this optimism is fragile and masks significant structural concerns including corporate guidance deterioration, Treasury market dysfunction, and demand destruction signals. Conviction is MEDIUM—sources agree on upside potential but highlight material downside risks that remain unpriced.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Fed rate-cut expectations supporting equity valuations despite underlying macro weakness; (2) AI productivity tailwinds competing with enterprise software margin concerns and guidance cuts; (3) Safe-haven capital flows into precious metals signaling macro uncertainty and risk-off rotation; (4) Treasury market stress (delivery fails at 8-year highs) and geopolitical escalation (Iran tensions, Taiwan defense spending) creating tail risks; (5) Consumer demand deterioration masked by headline retail data, with homebuyer activity and trade volumes declining significantly.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, only 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant support 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active). Near resistance: $750 (55k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI, dormant). /ES: 6978.60 support per Twitter; consolidation levels indicate sideways-to-down bias near-term.",
