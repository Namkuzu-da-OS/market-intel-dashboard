    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is **cautiously bullish with elevated risk** (conviction: medium). Bullish structural narratives (AI momentum, institutional capital concentration in mega-cap tech, monetary policy tailwinds) are countered by tactical bearish signals (mid-cap weakness, earnings disappointments, sentiment-technicals disconnect). The divergence between mega-cap strength and broad participation remains the critical tell.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **AI Infrastructure & Mega-Cap Tech Concentration** – Sustained institutional flows into semiconductor and AI-driven narratives, but narrowing participation signals potential crowding risk. (2) **Monetary Policy Tailwinds vs. Execution Risk** – Dovish Fed guidance supports valuations, but earnings revisions and guidance cuts in enterprise software and fintech suggest underlying demand softness. (3) **Geopolitical & Regulatory Uncertainty** – Taiwan/U.S.-China tensions and financial sector headwinds represent binary tail risks; defensive positioning emerging tactically despite bullish structural case.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** **SPY ($690.22):** Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE). Max Pain $687. **QQQ ($624.20):** Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 0.9%—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.5%—dormant). Near resistance $640 (31k OI, 2.5%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.1%—ACTIVE). Max Pain $620.",
