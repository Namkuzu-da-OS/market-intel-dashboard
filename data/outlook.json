    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is predominantly bullish (61-100% across sources), but bearish structural arguments present stronger foundational risk—creating a HIGH conviction mismatch between sentiment and systemic fragility. Consensus leans cautiously optimistic with underlying anxiety about contagion risks.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Defensive rotation into precious metals amid geopolitical and policy uncertainty; (2) Enterprise software sector vulnerability from guidance cuts spreading to correlated sectors; (3) Treasury market settlement stress (delivery fails at 8-year highs) signaling potential liquidity fragility; (4) AI/automation momentum versus rate-sensitive cyclical headwinds; (5) Complacency and blow-off rally characteristics in select assets (crypto, commodities) despite macro headwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% - active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6% - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI, 6.2% - dormant). Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6% - active), $625 (29k OI, 0.2% - active).",

QQQ: Resistance at $630 Call Wall (33k OI active) and $625 (29k OI active, nearly at price). Support at $620-$621 max pain zone.

Resistance if rallied: $700 Call Wall activation, then $730/$750 (55k OI - dormant, would require significant momentum). QQQ: Consolidation between $625-$630 with breakdown bias toward $590 Put Wall (164k OI dormant support, 5.4% below price) if $620-$621 fails. 5-10% pullback aligns with bearish structural thesis (Treasury stress, guidance cuts, complacency exhaustion).",
