    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets exhibit BULLISH sentiment (69-100% bullish across sources) with medium-to-high conviction, supported by monetary easing tailwinds, AI sector momentum, and commodity/crypto strength. However, bearish technical exhaustion signals in key assets (silver gap reversal risk, momentum divergence) and earnings headwinds (software/fintech guidance cuts) create a fragile equilibrium rather than robust conviction.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Monetary easing and rate-cut expectations driving risk-on positioning; (2) AI productivity adoption and infrastructure investment maintaining mega-cap leadership; (3) Commodity and crypto recovery testing sustainability amid technical exhaustion signals; (4) Earnings season bifurcation—AI/infrastructure strength vs. software/fintech weakness limiting breadth.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active), $625 (29k OI - active). Twitter source mentions /ES futures dynamics but specific levels not explicitly stated.",
