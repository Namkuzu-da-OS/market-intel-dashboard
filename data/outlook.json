    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium conviction - sources show 63-80% bullish sentiment across platforms, driven by all-time highs, VIX compression (13.77), and peak holiday liquidity, though structural concerns around earnings guidance cuts and demographic headwinds temper conviction.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector consolidation momentum and enterprise productivity validation driving tech leadership, (2) Peak liquidity conditions supporting risk-on positioning into early January, (3) Fiscal/regulatory uncertainty creating bifurcated outlook between technical momentum and fundamental deterioration signals.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $645 (125k OI), $650 (38k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, active support). Max Pain $619.
