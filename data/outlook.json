    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market exhibits MIXED conviction with bullish momentum in select assets (commodities, crypto, mega-cap tech) offset by deteriorating breadth and technical exhaustion signals. Conviction: MEDIUM. Bullish narratives rest on monetary policy tailwinds and productivity themes; bearish warnings cite breadth collapse and concentrated leadership masking underlying weakness.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Monetary policy easing cycle supporting rate-sensitive assets and growth equities; (2) AI/automation productivity narrative driving mega-cap tech valuations; (3) Breadth divergence and technical exhaustion in extended assets (commodities show exhaustion gap formations, momentum screener participation declining) signaling vulnerability to correction; (4) Execution risk in software and financial services with guidance cuts suggesting smoother earnings growth may not materialize; (5) Bifurcation between mainstream institutional optimism and concentrated positioning creating asymmetric downside risk.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support $670 (45k OI - active, 2.9%). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance $625 (29k OI - active, 0.2%), $640 (31k OI - active, 2.6%). Note: /ES futures levels per Twitter noted around support/resistance zones but attributed to Twitter source; Bitcoin >$90K and Ethereum >$3K per Twitter with complacency warnings; Silver showing exhaustion gaps and overhead resistance per Twitter; MicroStrategy support at $150 per Twitter.",

QQQ: Extremely tight range with $625-$630 resistance (both active hedging levels <1-2.6% away) and $590 put wall dormant below; intraday breakout above $630 would test $640 resistance, breakdown below $625 would test support.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: Primary resistance at $700 (call wall); if broken, next target $730-$750 (dormant resistance). Primary support at $670 (active, 2.9%), then $645 (dormant, 6.6%), then $640 put wall (dormant, 7.3%). Breakdown below $670 would signal shift toward $640. QQQ: Resistance at $630-$640 (both active); failure to break above suggests mean reversion toward $621 max pain, then $590 put wall. Twitter analysis warns of sideways-to-lower consolidation next 2-4 weeks with silver technical breakdown potentially accelerating broader correction; RSS warns of volatile range-bound trading with downside risks from earnings disappointments.",
