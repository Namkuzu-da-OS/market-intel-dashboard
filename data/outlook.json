    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market shows MIXED conviction with bullish structural tailwinds (AI infrastructure, capex momentum, monetary easing expectations) offsetting near-term bearish pressures (earnings deterioration, geopolitical friction, concentrated breadth). Conviction: MEDIUM—rally is real but fragile and vulnerable to liquidity shocks.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI mega-cap dominance vs. deteriorating market breadth—strength concentrated in $NVDA/$MSFT/$AMZN while mid/small-caps face active selling; (2) Policy uncertainty across regulatory tightening, geopolitical escalation (China, Ukraine, Taiwan), and Fed rate expectations creating bifurcated sector rotation; (3) Year-end liquidity environment amplifying volatility risk—low volume conditions masking underlying demand weakness in growth and cyclicals.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant until approached). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0%—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4%—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE). Per Twitter: /ES support floor 6,900 (SPX equivalent), resistance target 7,000 (SPX equivalent).",
