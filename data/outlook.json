    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show bullish headline sentiment (64-100% across sources) but with significant underlying structural concerns. Conviction is MEDIUM—bullish on indices masks breadth deterioration and earnings headwinds.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Precious metals momentum (silver strength) colliding with leverage/margin risks; (2) Tech sector divergence—AI narratives strong but software/fintech facing guidance pressure and regulatory tightening; (3) Breadth weakness and concentrated mega-cap flows sustaining headline indices despite economic data softening (trade volumes down, housing weakness, FDI at crisis lows).\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near-term active support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Active resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.2% away), $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away).",

    "intraday_levels": "SPY: Watch $700 call wall (active resistance, 1.4% above price)—dealer hedging will resist moves here. Support at $670 (active, 2.9% below). QQQ: Tight range—$625 (active resistance, near current price) and $630 (call wall, 1% away) define upside ceiling. Support deteriorates if $625 breaks; put wall at $590 (5.4% away) is dormant. Intraday likely constrained within these tight bands; breakout above $700 SPY or $630 QQQ requires volume surge to overcome active hedging.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Consolidation bias toward max pain ($686) over next 2-4 days, but sideways-to-lower expected 1-5 day window. First major test: $670 support (active, 2.9% below)—break below signals weakness cascade toward $645 dormant support (6.6% away). Upside capped at $700 call wall (1.4%); move above requires breakthrough, unlikely without new catalyst. QQQ: Critical weakness if $625 cannot hold (near current price, active resistance). Max pain gravitational pull at $621 suggests range-bound. Dormant put wall ($590, 5.4% below) becomes major support only if broader selling hits—this is the swing trader's target if breadth deteriorates further.",
