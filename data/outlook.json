    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** MIXED BULLISH with MEDIUM conviction - Structural tailwinds (AI infrastructure, Fed rate cuts, regulatory clarity) support upside, but tactical risks (margin debt at extremes, leverage unwinding, tariff-driven earnings pressure) create volatility and consolidation risk.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure dominance anchored by supply constraints and capital reallocation into semiconductors/cloud, (2) Fed rate-cut expectations driving sector rotation from mega-cap tech into utilities/real estate/automation plays, (3) Regulatory clarity catalysts (crypto guidance, autonomous vehicle approvals) reducing tail risks, (4) Margin debt/leverage concerns signaling potential deleveraging cycle vulnerability.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($676.47): Call Wall $680 (21k OI, 0.5% away - active resistance), Put Wall $660 (29k OI, 2.4% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $679 (14k OI), $677 (11k OI). Near support: $672 (15k OI), $670 (10k OI). QQQ ($609.11): Call Wall $610 (16k OI, 0.1% away - immediate resistance), Put Wall $585 (10k OI, 4.0% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $615 (9k OI), $620 (7k OI).
