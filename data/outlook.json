    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with bearish structural bias despite bullish headline narratives. Conviction: MEDIUM. Bullish headlines (AI momentum, mega-cap tech breakouts, dovish monetary policy) are contradicted by deteriorating breadth (mid-cap weakness), guidance cuts in enterprise software, and geopolitical uncertainty. The disconnect suggests profit-taking into thin holiday liquidity rather than sustainable continuation.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector momentum vs. broader market divergence - mega-cap tech strength masking deterioration in cyclicals and mid-caps; (2) Monetary policy expectations and financial system stress - rate cut narrative offset by banking supervisory tightening and margin compression; (3) Geopolitical risk-off positioning - Ukraine/Taiwan escalation concerns driving safe-haven demand; (4) Holiday liquidity constraints - thin trading volume amplifying price swings and making breakouts unreliable.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active, 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI - dormant, 6.6% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active, 2.6% away), $625 (29k OI - active, 0.2% away). Near support: $585 (137k OI - dormant, 6.2% away). Per Twitter: /ES resistance cited at 6940, mid-cap weakness ($IWM) signaling broader deterioration.",

Watch for failure to hold $625 on QQQ or $670 on SPY as intraday trigger for further weakness. Break below active support levels into dormant walls ($640 SPY, $590 QQQ) would confirm distribution.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Initial support $670 (active), primary support $645 (dormant, 6.6% away). Only break above $700 call wall with volume would negate bearish bias. QQQ: Testing $625/$630 resistance zone (both active). Primary support $590 (dormant, 5.4% away). Swing target on breakdown: $640 SPY, $585 QQQ, with potential extension if geopolitical catalyst triggers risk-off move. Max Pain gravitational pull remains at $687 (SPY) and $620 (QQQ)—expiration dynamics may pin prices toward these levels through early January.",
