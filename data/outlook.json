    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium-high conviction (74-80% bullish across sources), but with significant structural caveats - holiday momentum and rate postponement driving near-term strength while macro deterioration signals suggest fragility into early 2026.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Holiday seasonality and compressed trading volumes supporting risk-on positioning through year-end; (2) Rate policy uncertainty creating bifurcated outlook between near-term momentum and longer-term caution; (3) Sector rotation showing AI/infrastructure strength versus enterprise software/financial services weakness; (4) Commodity supercycle narratives at historic peaks potentially signaling exhaustion.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - active). Near support: $585 (137k OI). /ES: per Twitter, watching continuation vs breakdown at current levels. USD at 14-year support levels per Twitter.",
