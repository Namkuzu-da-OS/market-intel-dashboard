Market showing indecision at year-end.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Valuation extremes vs secular growth - US market cap-to-GDP at 218% record while AI/robotics/blockchain infrastructure promise multi-year tailwinds; (2) Regulatory tightening - Banking capital requirements, enterprise software guidance cuts, and fintech pressures creating sector-specific headwinds; (3) Institutional repositioning - Major players holding elevated cash (Berkshire 57% cash, $381.7B) while retail optimism persists on January seasonality.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.01): Call Wall $700 (144k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.3% away - dormant support). Max Pain $688. Near active support: $680 (60k OI). QQQ ($619.43): Call Wall $620 (39k OI, 0.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, 7.2% away - dormant). Max Pain $620.
