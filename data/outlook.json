    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates across all sources (76-100% bullish readings), but with mounting structural vulnerabilities creating a \"fragile bull\" scenario - high conviction near-term upside, medium conviction sustainability.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Valuation extremes at historical peaks (record P/E ratios) contrasting with strong fundamental data (4.3% GDP growth, double-digit EPS expectations), (2) Volatility complacency (VIX at 52-week lows) masking policy uncertainty around rate trajectory and fiscal sequencing, (3) Sector rotation dynamics with financials leading while tech/discretionary face earnings pressure and consumer stress signals (credit card delinquencies rising).\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, active resistance 2.0% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, dormant support 6.7% away). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $650 (38k OI), $645 (125k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, active resistance 3.3% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, active support 4.8% away). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI, at current price).
