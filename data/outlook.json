    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with bearish structural concerns offsetting near-term bullish momentum. Conviction is MEDIUM—sources agree on fragility despite headline strength, but diverge on immediate direction and catalysts.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Momentum divergence and distribution risk—broad market participation narrowing despite all-time highs; (2) Regulatory and earnings headwinds creating friction on growth sectors; (3) Precious metals exhaustion signaling potential broader liquidation and margin vulnerability; (4) Cryptocurrency momentum persisting but decoupling from equity direction; (5) Defensive positioning and flight-to-safety despite Fed easing narratives.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (150k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $630 (142k OI, 8.7% away—dormant). Max Pain $689. Near support (active): $680 (60k OI, 1.5%). Near support (dormant): $645 (126k OI, 6.6%). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $585 (137k OI, 6.2% away—dormant). Max Pain $623. Near resistance (active): $640 (31k OI + 29k OI combined, 2.6%). Both indices show bullish support bias via max pain proximity and put wall positioning, but active call walls at $700 (SPY) and $630 (QQQ) present immediate resistance with gamma hedging engagement.",

Watch for gamma-driven moves between these levels as price oscillates around max pain ($689). QQQ: Immediate resistance at $630 (33k OI call wall, 1.0% above—active). Support near $625 (max pain proximity). Breakout above $630 or breakdown below $620 would signal directional conviction.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: Consolidation expected between $680-$700 intraday, with swing-level risk to $645 (126k OI, 6.6% below—dormant support activates if approached). Break below $680 would target $630 (put wall, 8.7% away—major support floor). Upside to $730-$750 possible but requires breakout above $700 call wall with conviction. QQQ: Key support at $585 (137k OI put wall, 6.2% below). Break above $640 needed to invalidate bearish structure. Swing outlook favors pullback to $590-$600 range over 1-5 days given momentum divergence and distribution signals cited in RSS/Twitter.",
