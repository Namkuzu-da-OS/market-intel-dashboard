    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed directional sentiment with medium conviction - bullish on thematic/structural narratives (AI infrastructure, crypto regulatory clarity, defense spending) but bearish on immediate technicals (failed breakouts, momentum deterioration, Bitcoin rejection cascades). Market bifurcating between institutional-grade assets and overleveraged retail positions.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/semiconductor infrastructure maturation with institutional validation focus, (2) Cryptocurrency legislative clarity and TradFi integration driving sector strength, (3) Technical deterioration warnings across multiple asset classes despite fundamental bullish catalysts - concentration risk in mega-cap tech while traditional cyclicals face structural headwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.58): Call Wall $750 (56k OI, dormant), Put Wall $630 (149k OI, dormant). Max Pain $690. Near resistance: $693 (52k OI, active), $701 (52k OI, active). Near support: $680 (122k OI, active), $640 (101k OI, dormant). QQQ ($624.02): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, active), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, dormant). Max Pain $624. Near resistance: $627 (54k OI), $630 (32k OI). Near support: $610 (83k OI, active). /ES: 94k rejection level noted per Twitter for crypto correlation impact.",
