    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter shows 65% bullish sentiment anchored in earnings fundamentals, while RSS News leans 59% bullish but emphasizes near-term headwinds. YouTube analysts are unanimously bullish (100%) but lack bearish counterweight for analytical completeness. Overall: structural bullish case (AI/earnings growth) conflicts with tactical bearish concerns (breadth deterioration, holiday liquidity, geopolitical uncertainty).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Earnings-driven bull market persistence vs. distribution phase signals—consensus acknowledges strong YTD earnings contributions but flagged breadth collapse as warning sign. (2) AI/semiconductor sector momentum with rotation dynamics—specific divergence noted between mega-cap winners (NVDA highlighted) and deteriorating performance in enterprise software/fintech. (3) Year-end liquidity vulnerability and geopolitical risk elevation—holiday trading window creating vulnerability while Russia-Ukraine and Taiwan tensions create risk-off triggers. (4) Rate policy uncertainty and Fed supervisory tightening—capital requirements guidance and rate-cut optimism creating conflicting directional signals.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($688.13): Call Wall $700 (150k OI - ACTIVE hedging, 1.7% away), Put Wall $630 (142k OI - DORMANT, 8.4% away). Max Pain $689. Near support: $680 (60k OI - ACTIVE, 1.2% away), $645 (126k OI - DORMANT, 6.3% away). QQQ ($621.24): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - ACTIVE, 1.4% away), Put Wall $585 (137k OI - DORMANT, 5.8% away). Max Pain $623. Near support: $590 (77k OI - DORMANT, 5.0% away). Twitter mentions /ES resistance at 7,000 (prediction market focal point with 90% probability of failure per bearish analysis).",

Upside capped at $700 call wall; break above requires conviction not currently present. QQQ: Support cluster $590-$585 (77k and 137k OI dormant) represents 5-7% downside vulnerability. Call wall $630 capping near-term rallies. 1-5 day expectation: consolidation with downside tilt, testing support levels if geopolitical or earnings sentiment worsens.",
