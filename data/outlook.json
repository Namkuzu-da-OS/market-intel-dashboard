    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter sentiment is decidedly bullish (77%), but RSS News and YouTube analysts show more cautious positioning (55% and 50% bullish respectively), while the professional trader data reveals significant bearish skew (13% bullish). This divergence suggests retail/social media optimism is not matched by institutional conviction or professional trader positioning.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Mega-cap tech and AI infrastructure momentum narrative persists, but technical exhaustion warnings in mid-caps and growth assets suggest momentum may be fragile; (2) Year-end liquidity concerns and options expiry dynamics creating near-term headwinds despite positive macro narratives; (3) Corporate earnings execution lagging forward-looking bull case—guidance cuts in large-cap software and financial services represent concrete downside pressure against optimistic sentiment.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.17): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near resistance: $730 (48k OI, dormant), $750 (55k OI, dormant). Near support: $670 (45k OI, active), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($624.53): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active at 0.9% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant at 5.5% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, active), $625 (29k OI, active). Near support: $585 (137k OI, dormant). Per Twitter: /ES levels around 6940–7000 breakout zone mentioned as bullish target if 6900 holds. NVDA sustained action above $190 cited as sector health indicator.",

QQQ: Resistance at $630 (active call wall, 33k OI) and $625 (active, 29k OI). Support at $590. Watch for consolidation between call/put walls; professional trader bearishness suggests selling into strength toward $700 SPY / $630 QQQ resistance.",

Downside scenario favored by RSS News and professional trader data. QQQ: Similar structure—$630 call wall capped upside; $590 put wall (164k OI) provides downside protection but only if price declines >5.5%. Swing traders should favor selling rallies into call walls and watching for breakdown below $670 SPY / $590 QQQ as confirmation of bearish thesis.",
