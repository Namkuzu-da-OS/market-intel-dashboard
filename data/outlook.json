    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market exhibits bullish bias with medium-to-high conviction driven by AI/productivity narratives and large-cap mega-stock momentum, but bifurcated structure reveals critical vulnerability—consensus optimism in secondary names and risk assets masks quiet deterioration in mid-cap liquidity, creating asymmetric tail risk into year-end.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI platform monetization and large-cap tech leadership sustaining index strength; (2) Bifurcated market structure—mega-cap beneficiaries levitating while mid-caps/small-caps show liquidation pressure; (3) Year-end liquidity dynamics and potential correction vulnerability if momentum reverses; (4) Rate policy uncertainty and Fed easing narratives supporting equity valuations; (5) Cyclical capex acceleration themes offsetting near-term earnings disappointment headwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.06): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI - dormant 6.5% away). QQQ ($624.22): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging 0.9% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant 5.5% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - active 2.5% away), $625 (29k OI - active 0.1% away).",

If $670 breaks, max pain $687 and put support $640 (7.3% away) define downside. QQQ: Resistance zone $625-$630; breakthrough suggests $640 (2.5% active). Support discipline at $620 (max pain) and $590 (5.5% dormant put wall).
