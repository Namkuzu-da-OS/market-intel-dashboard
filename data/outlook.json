    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Cautiously bullish into year-end with medium conviction. Sources show 65-100% bullish sentiment across platforms, but technical resistance and year-end positioning dynamics create near-term headwinds despite structural tailwinds from rate cuts and institutional accumulation.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Regulatory clarity expectations driving crypto infrastructure positioning and stablecoin adoption narratives, (2) Semiconductor and tech sector leadership continuing to drive indices despite K-shaped economy concentration concerns, (3) Year-end tax-loss selling creating tactical volatility while institutional players selectively accumulate in favored segments.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($684.77): Call Wall $700 (106k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $681. Near active support: $680 (69k OI). QQQ ($617.20): Call Wall $620 (34k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, dormant support). Max Pain $615. Near active resistance: $630 (33k OI). /ES futures: WTD VWAP barriers mentioned per Twitter as key resistance levels.",
