    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed conviction with bifurcated market structure. Bullish thesis (67% X sentiment, 57% RSS, 100% professional trader) centers on monetary easing and AI tailwinds, while bearish technical evidence (X analysis showing silver breakdown, momentum divergence, overbought extremes) suggests near-term exhaustion despite headline strength. Medium conviction overall—upside narrative is compelling but technical deterioration is real.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Monetary policy accommodation driving growth/tech re-rating; (2) Bifurcated sector performance—technology/AI beneficiaries vs. regulatory pressure on financials; (3) Commodity exhaustion and distribution concerns despite bull market narratives; (4) Earnings guidance credibility—whether weakness is transitory or structural; (5) Geopolitical tail risk overhang.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—active), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI, 6.2%—dormant). Per X analysis: MSTR $150.60 critical support; SLV 71.22 trigger/73.16 target; JPM 330.86 trigger/336 target; GOOGL 313.89 trigger/321.58 target; NFLX 94.71 trigger/97 target referenced for options expiration early January.",

    "intraday_bias": "NEUTRAL",
    "intraday_levels": "SPY: Watch $700 call wall as active resistance (146k OI, 1.4% away). Support at $670 (45k OI, 2.9% away—active hedging). QQQ: $630 call wall (33k OI—active resistance, 1.0% away), $625 and $640 both within 2.6% with meaningful OI—expect choppy consolidation near these levels. Key test: whether bullish technical defense of $670 SPY and $625 QQQ holds or gives way to dormant support testing ($640 SPY, $590 QQQ). Monitor options expiration mechanics early January around the specified levels (MSTR, SLV, JPM, GOOGL, NFLX).",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Bullish bias supported by Put Wall at $640 (153k OI—robust downside cushion, 7.3% away). Target upside toward $730 (48k OI, 5.7%—dormant resistance) if momentum sustains. QQQ: Put Wall at $590 (164k OI—strong support, 5.4% away) favors bounce/consolidation; resistance at $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active). Max Pain gravity: SPY $686, QQQ $621 act as near-term attractors. 1-5 day moves likely constrained between active support/resistance zones unless technical breakdown (silver/momentum divergence) triggers waterfall. Upside scenario: consolidation holding $670+ SPY, $625+ QQQ, then test $700/$630 call walls. Downside scenario: failure to defend active support levels cascades toward dormant put walls.",
