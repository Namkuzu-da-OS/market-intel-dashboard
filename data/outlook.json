    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish momentum dominant across most sources (70% X, 62% RSS, 86% YouTube) but fragile—professional trader heavily bearish (0% bullish). Conviction: MEDIUM (conflicting professional sentiment creates doubt).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/tech sector resilience driving tech leadership narratives despite valuation extremes at Dot Com Bubble levels, (2) Rate cut expectations sustaining risk-on sentiment while labor market deterioration (4.6% unemployment since June) creates structural tension, (3) Commodity/crypto rotation with regulatory clarity tailwinds versus software/retail earnings quality concerns and guidance cuts.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($678.87): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, active resistance 0.3% away), Put Wall $677 (11k OI, active support 0.3% away). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $678 (10k OI), $675 (10k OI). Net Bias: BEARISH_RESISTANCE. QQQ ($611.75): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, active resistance 0.5% away), Put Wall $610 (9k OI, active support 0.3% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $613 (11k OI), $614 (8k OI). Near support: $609 (8k OI), $595 (7k OI). Net Bias: NEUTRAL. /ES: 50-DMA breakdown target toward 6400-6350 range per Twitter if support fails.",
