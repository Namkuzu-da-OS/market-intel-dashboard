    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish momentum in tech ($NVDA, $META, $ORCL) and broad indices contrasts with acute bearish pressures from software/fintech guidance cuts, regulatory tightening, and geopolitical tensions. Near-term consolidation dominates with elevated tail risks.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Tech infrastructure breakouts vs. mid-cap liquidation in low-volume conditions; (2) Regulatory headwinds (financial services margin compression, supervisory tightening) offsetting Fed rate-cut optimism; (3) Geopolitical risk-off (China policy uncertainty, U.S.-China tensions) creating safe-haven demand and positioning fragility; (4) Year-end liquidity squeeze amplifying volatility in illiquid segments (crypto, small caps).\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—active). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0%—active hedging), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4%—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—active). Per Twitter: /ES targeting 7000 with 6900 support; /NVDA targeting $200 breakout from $191 resistance; /ORCL targeting $200 breakout.",

Support zone $670-$640 provides safety net over next 1-5 days; break below $640 would invalidate bullish bias and test lower put wall. QQQ: $630-$640 resistance zone critical; sustained close above $640 validates bullish momentum toward $650+. Support: $620 (max pain gravitational pull), $590 put wall (5.4% away—activates on sharp pullback). Swing traders: favor longs on $670/$620 bounces with stops below $640/$585.",
