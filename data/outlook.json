    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show bullish structural support (mega-cap momentum, AI conviction, Fed easing bias) with medium-to-high conviction, but bifurcated breadth (mid-cap weakness, crypto underperformance despite positive sentiment) creates tactical vulnerability. Conviction level: MEDIUM—rally continuation likely on light holiday volume, but durability depends on divergence resolution in early January.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/Mega-Cap Dominance—SPX pushing toward structural targets, NVDA/ORCL showing relative strength despite volatility; (2) Year-End Liquidation Cycles—concentrated selling in IWM and BTC despite positive retail sentiment signals distribution risk; (3) Geopolitical & Regulatory Headwinds—China sanctions uncertainty, corporate guidance deterioration, and macro policy shifts constraining near-term conviction.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.03): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($624.04): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.5% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, ACTIVE). Per Twitter: /ES consolidation above 6900 critical for 7000 test.",
