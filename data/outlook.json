    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED conviction with bullish technicals (97% buy rating on mega-cap tech, support level holds) offset by bearish fundamentals (earnings disappointments, regulatory tightening, overbought conditions). Sentiment is MEDIUM conviction—consolidation expected with elevated downside risk.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector momentum and consolidation winners vs. laggards—structural capital deployment driving differentiation. (2) Rate policy uncertainty and forward-looking Fed easing creating bifurcation between rate-beneficiary sectors (utilities, financials) and structural headwind sectors (software, pharma, fintech). (3) Holiday liquidity thinness amplifying volatility vulnerability—thin trading environments creating cascading liquidation risk if key technical thresholds break.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.30): Call Wall $700 (150k OI—active hedging 1.8% away), Put Wall $630 (142k OI—dormant support 8.3% away). Max Pain $689. Near support: $680 (60k OI, active 1.1% away), $645 (126k OI, dormant 6.2% away). QQQ ($620.13): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active hedging 1.6% away), Put Wall $585 (137k OI—dormant support 5.7% away). Max Pain $623. Near support: $590 (77k OI, active 4.9% away), $574.78 (123k OI, dormant 7.3% away). Critical pivot: VIX at 15 threshold—break above signals gap-down risk. Bitcoin $84,500 support per X (crypto positioning stop-loss level).",

Daily close below $680 triggers test of $645. Rally above $700 faces $730/$750 resistance (dormant until approached). QQQ: $590 support (77k OI, active 4.9% away) is critical 1–5 day level.
