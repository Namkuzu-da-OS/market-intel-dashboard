    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is predominantly bullish (60-100% across sources) with medium-to-high conviction, driven by AI momentum and seasonal tailwinds, but underpinned by significant structural macro concerns that create asymmetric tail risk. Near-term strength is expected, but underlying vulnerabilities (record debt, policy uncertainty, geopolitical tensions) suggest elevated probability of correction within broader 2026 timeframe.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and technology leadership continuing to dominate capital flows; (2) Rate-cut cycle and Fed policy support enabling equity bid despite profitability compression in select sectors; (3) Precious metals strength as institutional safe-haven rotation, signaling macro caution beneath surface bullish sentiment; (4) Sector bifurcation—AI/tech/utilities favored while financials, software, and rate-sensitive sectors face near-term headwinds; (5) Geopolitical and policy uncertainty creating tail risks that contrast with consensus bullishness.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near active support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active hedging, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near active resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.2% away), $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away). Both indices show bullish-support bias with active dealer hedging at resistance; dormant put walls at $640 (SPY) and $590 (QQQ) represent secondary support if momentum breaks.",

Support at $590 (dormant, 5.4% away). Intraday action likely contained within call-wall resistance; dealer hedging should provide friction at $700 SPY and $630 QQQ.",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Watch $700 call wall as initial 1-5 day resistance; break above would target $730-$750 (dormant, 5.7-8.6% away) if momentum sustains. Support: $670 (active, 2.9% away) is primary hold-level; loss below $670 triggers dormant put wall at $640. QQQ: Immediate resistance $630 call wall (active, 1.0% away); break above targets $640 (active, 2.6% away). Support: $625 (active, 0.2% away) and secondary $590 put wall (dormant, 5.4% away). Swing-term bias favors testing call walls but facing dealer selling as price approaches resistance.",
