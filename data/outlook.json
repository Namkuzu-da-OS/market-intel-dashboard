    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show mixed conviction with bullish technical momentum in mega-cap indices (SPX near all-time highs) offset by bearish structural concerns (mid-cap weakness, crypto volatility, geopolitical tensions). Conviction: MEDIUM—near-term upside bias supported by options positioning and trader sentiment, but underlying breadth deterioration and guidance weakness create vulnerability.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI/semiconductor sector leadership concentration in mega-cap tech; (2) Rate policy uncertainty and Fed clarity expectations; (3) Capital expenditure cycles supporting cyclical sectors; (4) Mid-cap and small-cap relative weakness versus large-cap outperformance; (5) Year-end liquidity constraints and profit-taking headwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.20): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—DORMANT). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE). QQQ ($624.31): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 0.9% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.5% away—DORMANT). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $625 (29k OI, 0.1%—ACTIVE), $640 (31k OI, 2.5%—ACTIVE). Twitter attributes /ES support at 6,900 (with 7,000 as bullish target if support holds).",
