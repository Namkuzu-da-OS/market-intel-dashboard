Bullish bias dominates sentiment (77% X, 60% RSS, 100% YouTube) but contrarian signals from weak mid-cap/crypto performance and professional trader bearishness suggest caution. Conviction: MEDIUM.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Mega-cap AI/tech momentum concentration risk vs. broader market weakness; (2) Post-holiday liquidity normalization as potential volatility catalyst; (3) Structural Fed easing support offset by near-term earnings/guidance execution risks; (4) Geopolitical escalation as macro wildcard; (5) Bifurcated market revealing unhealthy concentration in handful of leaders.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.92): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.5% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.2% away—dormant until approached). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.5%—dormant). QQQ ($624.10): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 0.9%—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.5%—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.5%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.1%—ACTIVE). Per Twitter: S&P 500 support at 6900 (futures proxy), NVDA technical range $190–$200, ORCL $200 breakout target flagged.\",\n  \"source_alignment\": \"MIXED\",\n  \"conflicts\": \"X/Twitter and YouTube show overwhelming bullish sentiment (77–100%) vs. professional trader heavily bearish (15% bullish, 85% bearish). RSS News sits between (60% bullish) but emphasizes near-term bearish catalysts (software guidance cuts, regulatory pressure) offsetting structural bullish tailwinds. Key disconnect: consensus sentiment is bullish on macro/structural themes (AI, Fed easing, capex) but professional trader and RSS News flag immediate execution risks (earnings misses, holiday liquidity thinness) that could trigger sharp reversals. Contrarian red flags: Bitcoin down 7% YTD despite overwhelming bullish conviction; mid-cap weakness ($IWM) suggesting profit-taking despite mega-cap strength.\",\n  \"intraday_bias\": \"NEUTRAL\",\n  \"intraday_levels\": \"SPY: Watch $700 call wall (active hedging, 1.5% resistance). Support at $670 (2.9% active support) and $689.92 current level near max pain ($687). QQQ: Tightly ranged with $625–$630 zone as active resistance (call walls at both levels). Below $624 watch for $590 put wall activation (dormant). /ES per Twitter: 6900 support critical for bullish continuation.\",\n  \"swing_bias\": \"BULLISH\",\n  \"swing_levels\": \"SPY: Rally target toward $700 call wall resistance; if broken, $730 and $750 dormant resistance zones become relevant (5.8% and 8.7% away). Support holds at $670 (active) then $640 put wall (7.2% away—major support). QQQ: $630 call wall and $640 resistance are swing targets; below, $620 max pain and $590 put wall.
