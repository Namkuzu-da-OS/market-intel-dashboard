    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED conviction with bearish structural concerns (record global debt, regulatory tightening, earnings downgrades) offsetting bullish forward narratives (AI adoption, rate relief potential). Conviction: MEDIUM. Near-term downside bias dominates, but institutional accumulation on weakness suggests tactical nature of selloff.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Regulatory headwinds in banking/enterprise software creating near-term earnings pressure; (2) AI and autonomous vehicle adoption narrative remains intact but faces 2026 timing dependency; (3) Rate policy uncertainty and Fed communication clarity as near-term pivot catalyst; (4) Cryptocurrency volatility and leveraged position liquidation risk; (5) Year-end options expiry volatility in equities and crypto indices.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant support, 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active at 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI, dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI - both active). Per Twitter sources: /ES support cited at 6550 level (broader correction threshold).",

Upside limited to $700 call wall (active resistance). QQQ: Primary support at $590 put wall (164k OI, significant). Resistance at $630 call wall. Consolidation likely between $625-$640 range before directional resolve. Max Pain gravitational pull: SPY $686, QQQ $621 - expect mean-reversion bias toward these strikes through expiration window.",
