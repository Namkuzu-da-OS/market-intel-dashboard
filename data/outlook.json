    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Cautiously bullish near-term with medium conviction, supported by seasonal flows and institutional deployment, but facing structural headwinds from valuation extremes (218% market cap-to-GDP), regulatory pressures, and deteriorating breadth.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum and institutional capital deployment into robotics/autonomy, (2) January seasonal tailwinds versus triple-top technical formation concerns, (3) Rate policy uncertainty with Fed hawkish signals contradicting cut expectations, (4) Housing infrastructure thesis driven by mortgage spread normalization, (5) Regulatory headwinds across banking, fintech, and software sectors.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.01): Call Wall $700 (144k OI - 1.9% away, active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI - dormant support). Max Pain $688. Near support: $680 (60k OI, active), $640 (100k OI, dormant). QQQ ($619.43): Call Wall $620 (39k OI - 0.1% away, active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI - dormant support). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $630 (32k OI), $640 (31k OI). Per Twitter: Nasdaq testing triple-top formation levels; institutional cash positioning (Berkshire $381.7B, 57% of portfolio) signals hedging.",
