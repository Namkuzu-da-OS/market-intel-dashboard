    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets exhibit a bullish structural bias supported by regulatory tailwinds, AI infrastructure narratives, and dovish policy positioning, but near-term execution risk from year-end liquidity constraints and sector-specific earnings headwinds creates a cautious-optimism backdrop. Conviction: MEDIUM—bullish themes are clear, but tactical pullback risk is elevated through early January.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and capex momentum driving secular growth narratives; (2) Regulatory clarity and policy accommodation (crypto easing, dovish Fed stance, autonomous vehicle clarity) reducing policy uncertainty; (3) Year-end liquidity constraints and profit-taking pressuring mid-caps and leveraged positions, with forced liquidations creating tactical volatility.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant until approached). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE).",

QQQ: $630 call wall (active, 1.0% away) as immediate ceiling; $625-$640 zone contains active hedging. Expect choppy intraday action with thin holiday liquidity.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY swing target: If $700 call wall is penetrated on elevated volume (breaking active hedging), next resistance $730 (5.7%, 48k OI—dormant, activates on approach). Support floor: $640 put wall (153k OI, 7.3% below price—dormant until breached, then becomes major bid). Likely 1-5 day scenario: Test $700, fail into $687 max pain, then consolidate $670-$690 range before potential early-January breakout above $700 on technicals + dovish policy narrative. QQQ: $630-$640 resistance band contains both call walls—watch for breakout; failure pulls back toward $620 max pain and $590 put wall (164k OI—structural support if reached).",
