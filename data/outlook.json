    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market exhibits **MIXED conviction with bullish structural bias tempered by tactical fragility**. Sources show 79% aggregate bullish sentiment (111B Twitter, 25B RSS, 1B YouTube, 6B Trader = 143 bullish vs. 72 bearish combined), but conviction is MEDIUM—bullish narratives rest on intact support and upcoming catalysts, while bearish risks center on overbought technicals, holiday liquidity thinness, and precious metals liquidation cascade with historical systemic spillover precedent.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **AI productivity and large-cap tech consolidation**—mega-cap mega-cap tech holding support levels with exceptional analyst conviction, positioned as accumulation opportunity rather than exhaustion. (2) **Rate policy uncertainty and financial-sector headwinds**—Fed communication clarity contested; banking supervision tightening and enterprise software guidance cuts creating sector bifurcation favoring growth over financials/healthcare. (3) **Crypto ecosystem volatility and metals liquidation risk**—precious metals liquidation cascade flagged as systemic barometer; Bitcoin support levels critical for ecosystem health signals. (4) **Thin holiday liquidity amplifying tactical risk**—year-end positioning creates gap-down vulnerability despite structural bullish case.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** **SPY ($686.97):** Call Wall $700 (150k OI—ACTIVE hedging, 1.9% away), Put Wall $630 (142k OI—dormant until approached, 8.3% away). Max Pain $689. Near support: $680 (60k OI—ACTIVE, 1.0% away), $645 (126k OI—dormant, 6.1% away). Net bias NEUTRAL. | **QQQ ($619.55):** Call Wall $620 (34k OI—ACTIVE hedging, 0.1% away), Put Wall $585 (137k OI—dormant, 5.6% away). Max Pain $623. Near resistance: $630 (33k OI—ACTIVE, 1.7% away), $640 (31k OI—ACTIVE, 3.3% away). Near support: $590 (77k OI—ACTIVE, 4.8% away). Net bias BULLISH_SUPPORT.",

Support $590 (77k OI, 4.8% away). **Watch for:** Holiday liquidity whipsaw between $680-$700 SPY; QQQ Call Wall compression at $620 suggests tight trading range intraday.",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "**SPY swing setup:** Bullish if holds support at $680/$645 (Max Pain $689 acts as gravitational anchor); bears need break and close below $645 to invalidate bullish thesis and target $630 Put Wall. **QQQ swing setup:** Bullish bias confirmed if QQQ holds $590 support and breaks above $630/$640 resistance cluster (31k-33k OI); these represent technical gatekeepers for multi-day move. Max Pain $623 QQQ suggests mean-reversion pull within 1-5 days. **Risk:** Metals liquidation cascade or gap-down execution in first 2 hours could trigger stop-loss cascade toward $645 SPY before recovering into Max Pain gravity.",
