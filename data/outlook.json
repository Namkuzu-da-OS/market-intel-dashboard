    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish sources (YouTube, Professional Trader, RSS News at 75%) emphasize precious metals strength and potential Fed policy accommodation, while bearish sources (X Twitter at 56% bullish, RSS structural concerns) highlight macro deterioration in trade volumes, housing demand, and treasury market stress. The market is bifurcated between near-term headwinds (regulatory tightening, earnings pressure, geopolitical risk) and longer-duration tailwinds (AI productivity, policy easing potential).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Safe-haven rotation into precious metals and defensive sectors (utilities, healthcare, defense) as risk-off sentiment builds; (2) Regulatory and supervisory tightening creating near-term earnings guidance pressure across enterprise software, fintech, and growth names; (3) Geopolitical tension (Taiwan-China, Russia-Ukraine, Iran rhetoric) sustaining capital flight risk and volatility uncertainty; (4) Treasury market structural stress (delivery fails, yield trajectory uncertainty) anchoring valuation debates between growth and defensive positioning.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near-term support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near-term resistance: $640 (31k OI - active 2.6%), $625 (29k OI - active 0.2%). /ES: 6978.6 support per Twitter (near-term momentum test). Both indices show BULLISH_SUPPORT bias from options positioning despite qualitative bearish structural concerns.",

QQQ: Resistance at $630 call wall (33k OI, active) and $625 (29k OI, very tight). Support at $590 put wall if approached. /ES: Test of 6978.6 support level per Twitter will determine near-term momentum. Expect choppy range-bound action near max pain ($686 SPY, $621 QQQ) with potential for consolidation rather than directional conviction.",
    "swing_bias": "BEARISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: 5-day bias tilts bearish if breaks below $670 support (active level). Intermediate target $640 put wall if structural deterioration (trade, housing, regulatory) accelerates. Upside cap at $700 call wall with major resistance at $730-750 (dormant, high OI). QQQ: More vulnerable given tighter options structure. Resistance $630-640, support $590 put wall. A break below $625 (currently active) could accelerate bearish move toward $590. Sources warn earnings guidance cuts and regulatory overhang will persist through early January, suggesting defensive rotation extends beyond intraday horizon. Precious metals consolidation and geopolitical developments will signal 1-5 day directional bias.",
