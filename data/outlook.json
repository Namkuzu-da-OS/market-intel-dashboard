    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates (83% X, 64% RSS, 100% YouTube) but structural fragility creates medium-low conviction. Market caught between institutional adoption narratives and extreme valuation/sentiment warnings.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and semiconductor supply constraints driving mega-cap tech momentum, (2) Crypto institutional legitimization vs security/operational risks creating bifurcated flows, (3) Supply-side tailwinds (Venezuela oil normalization thesis) competing against consumer demand deterioration and geopolitical fragmentation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($691.81): Call Wall $750 (55k OI, 8.4% away - dormant), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.9% away - dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $680 (85k OI, 1.7% - ACTIVE). Near resistance: $693 (48k OI, 0.2% - ACTIVE). QQQ ($623.42): Call Wall $641 (55k OI, 2.8% away - ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $574.78 (116k OI, 7.8% away - dormant). Max Pain $618. Near resistance: $627 (53k OI, 0.6% - ACTIVE), $630 (33k OI, 1.1% - ACTIVE). /ES: 6847 support mentioned per Twitter; Japanese 30-year yields at 3.527% ATH per Twitter.",
