    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED sentiment with structural bullish themes offsetting near-term bearish headwinds. Conviction is MEDIUM—institutional capital supports longer-term narratives, but near-term profit-taking and holiday liquidity constraints create tactical downside risk.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Regulatory tailwinds and institutional capital deployment (crypto ETF accumulation, deregulation optimism), (2) AI capex expansion and technology sector momentum competing against enterprise software guidance weakness, (3) Year-end liquidity constraints and holiday-driven volatility creating near-term consolidation before Q1 capital flows.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI—active hedging, 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI—dormant, 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI—active), $645 (126k OI—dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI—active, 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI—dormant, 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near support: $585 (137k OI—dormant). Both indices showing bullish support structure with active dealer hedging near-term.",
