    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish momentum with significant year-end vulnerability. Structural tailwinds (AI infrastructure, commodity supply constraints, capex acceleration) support longer-term strength, but thin holiday volume and profit-taking pressure create tactical downside risk in the near term. Conviction: MEDIUM-HIGH on direction, but MEDIUM on timing stability.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI-driven infrastructure expansion and enterprise capex acceleration as primary growth driver; (2) Precious metals and cryptocurrency supply constraints supporting alternative asset positioning; (3) Year-end liquidity withdrawal and volatility as seasonal headwind, with potential relief rally in early 2026; (4) Bifurcated market performance—tech/utilities outperforming while financials and discretionary face headwinds; (5) Geopolitical uncertainty and policy risk as secondary but elevated concern.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.4% away—ACTIVE hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away—dormant until approached). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.9%—ACTIVE), $645 (126k OI, 6.6%—dormant). | QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—ACTIVE). | Per Twitter: /ES noted as 6800s level zone per trader commentary.",

Low volume expected into year-end—breakouts may lack follow-through; consolidation more likely than directional conviction.",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Support holding at $670–$687 (max pain zone); break above $700 call wall targets $720–$750 (dormant resistance). QQQ: Support at $620 (max pain); resistance at $630–$640 (active and dormant call walls). Put wall support at $640 SPY and $590 QQQ provides 5–7% downside cushion before gamma acceleration lower. Structural bias suggests relief rally into early 2026 if consolidation holds.",
