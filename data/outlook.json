    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** BEARISH with MEDIUM conviction. Market faces near-term downside pressure from technical deterioration, regulatory headwinds, and disappointing earnings execution, though medium-term structural support exists from institutional adoption and liquidity themes.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Technical breakdown risk across major indices and crypto - Bitcoin, Ethereum, QQQ showing structural weakness; (2) Defensive rotation amid earnings disappointments in enterprise software and regulatory tightening in banking supervision; (3) Institutional adoption themes (crypto platforms, AI infrastructure) creating sector-specific divergence despite macro headwinds.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($681.76): Call Wall $695 (7k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (13k OI, 1.7% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $690 (7k OI), $700 (6k OI). Near support: $680 (5k OI), $661 (9k OI). QQQ ($613.62): Call Wall $645 (26k OI, 5.1% away - dormant), Put Wall $610 (6k OI, 0.6% away - active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $635 (6k OI), $640 (6k OI). Near support: $585 (4k OI). /ES: 6847 support flagged per Twitter sentiment, with Bitcoin support at $125 noted as critical.",
