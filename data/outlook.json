    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Markets show MIXED conviction with bearish structural arguments currently outweighing bullish narratives. Bearish thesis is grounded in concrete headwinds (exhaustion signals, breadth deterioration, guidance cuts, regulatory pressure), while bullish case relies on forward-looking stimulus hopes. Conviction: MEDIUM.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Exhaustion and mean reversion risk in momentum trades—extended rallies showing deteriorating breadth and unsustainable positioning, (2) Macro headwinds masking sector concentration—trade volume declines and housing weakness contrasting with tech/precious metals strength, (3) Regulatory and operational uncertainty—guidance cuts and enforcement actions creating \"show me\" environment before risk-on resumes, (4) Volatility as defining characteristic—year-end positioning and margin dynamics could amplify moves in either direction.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI, dormant 6.6% away). | QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, active 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near support: $585 (137k OI, dormant 6.2% away), resistance: $640 (31k OI, active 2.6% away), $625 (29k OI, active 0.2% away).",

Break above $700 faces $730/$750 dormant resistance. | QQQ 1-5 day: $625-$630 resistance zone (active levels, 62k OI combined) likely caps upside; $590 put wall (164k OI, dormant) provides swing floor if momentum reverses. Max Pain gravity at SPY $686 and QQQ $621 suggests mean reversion toward these strikes by expiration.",
