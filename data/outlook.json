    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market exhibits bifurcated sentiment with bullish technical momentum in mega-cap AI leaders offset by structural bearish concerns around year-end liquidity, leverage, and regulatory headwinds. Conviction: MEDIUM. Bullish case concentrates on forward AI capital spending themes; bearish case anchors in concrete near-term pressures (crypto liquidation risk, profit-taking, geopolitical uncertainty, earnings revisions).\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI-driven capital expenditure momentum and mega-cap breakout potential; (2) Year-end liquidity constraints, profit-taking pressure, and crypto leverage positioning creating asymmetric downside risk in mid-caps; (3) Regulatory tightening and earnings revisions in software/fintech/pharma vs. defensive positioning in utilities and AI enablers.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, active 2.9% away), $645 (126k OI, dormant 6.6% away). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant 5.4% away). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, active 2.6% away), $625 (29k OI, active 0.2% away). Per X/Twitter: $NVDA resistance $190-191, target $200.",
