    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed-to-cautious sentiment with low-to-medium conviction. X/Twitter and RSS sources highlight near-term technical weakness and policy headwinds despite bullish seasonality expectations, while quantitative sentiment readings remain broadly bullish (62-100% across sources). The disconnect between narrative caution and sentiment optimism suggests a market at an inflection point.\n\n📈 **Themes:** Rate policy uncertainty and higher-for-longer expectations weighing on valuations; AI/tech sector momentum facing technical deterioration signals in mega-caps; sector rotation toward defensive positioning and precious metals as risk-off hedges; holiday seasonality dynamics with Santa Rally thesis being tested.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.38): Call Wall $700 (150k OI) - ACTIVE resistance 1.4% away, Put Wall $640 (153k OI) - dormant support 7.3% away. Max Pain $684. Near support: $645 (125k OI), $650 (41k OI). QQQ ($623.93): Call Wall $640 (31k OI) - ACTIVE resistance 2.6% away, near resistance $630 (30k OI) - ACTIVE at 1.0% away, Put Wall $590 (164k OI) - dormant support 5.4% away. Max Pain $617. Net bias on both: BULLISH_SUPPORT from dealer positioning.",
