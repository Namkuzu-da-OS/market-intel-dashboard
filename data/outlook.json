    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Twitter shows strong bullish bias (77%) centered on mega-cap tech momentum, while RSS News leans bearish (62% bullish) citing earnings disappointments and regulatory headwinds. YouTube presents unilateral bullish optimism, but professional trader data is heavily cautious (17% bullish), creating a conflicted overall picture—strength in mega-caps masking underlying sector weakness.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **AI Infrastructure & Mega-Cap Momentum** — Broad institutional participation in mega-cap tech ($NVDA, $MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL, $AMZN) with AI monetization as dominant narrative; (2) **Sector Divergence Risk** — Mid-cap weakness ($IWM underperformance) during low-volume year-end period raises distribution concerns despite mega-cap strength; (3) **Earnings Execution Risk** — Financial and enterprise software sectors facing margin compression and profitability warnings; regulatory uncertainty adding pressure.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($689.46): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 1.5% away—active hedging), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.2% away—dormant). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI, 2.8%—active), $645 (126k OI, 6.4%—dormant). QQQ ($623.80): Call Wall $630 (33k OI, 1.0% away—active), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% away—dormant). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI, 2.6%—active), $625 (29k OI, 0.2%—active). Per Twitter: /ES 6900 cited as support, 7000 as year-end target (SpX equivalent ~$689–$700 range).",

    "intraday_levels": "SPY: Resistance at $700 (146k OI call wall—active hedging). Support at $670 (45k OI, active delta hedging) and Max Pain $687. QQQ: Resistance cluster at $625–$630 (combined ~62k OI, both active). Watch for consolidation within these bands; breakout above $700 SPY would confirm bullish narrative, breakdown below $670 would favor bearish thesis.",
    "swing_bias": "BULLISH",
    "swing_levels": "SPY: Upside target $700–$750 (call walls dormant above); confirmed support $670 (active). Downside critical support $640 (put wall—dormant but defensive). QQQ: Upside $630–$640 (call walls); support $620 (max pain), then $590 (put wall). 1–5 day outlook leans bullish given active call wall hedging at SPY $700 and QQQ $630, but vulnerability emerges if daily closes below $670 SPY or $620 QQQ.",
