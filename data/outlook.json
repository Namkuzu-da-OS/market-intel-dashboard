    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish sentiment dominates across sources (68% weighted bullish), but with medium conviction as structural headwinds undermine technical strength. Late-cycle rally dynamics suggest upside continuation into year-end with elevated reversal risk.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI sector momentum and productivity narrative sustaining tech leadership despite narrowing breadth, (2) Rate policy uncertainty as market expectations for accommodation clash with Fed hawkish signals, (3) Regulatory environment shifts across crypto/housing (bullish catalysts) versus European tech (restrictive overhang), (4) Earnings guidance deterioration in enterprise software and financials masked by headline strength.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.01): Call Wall $700 (144k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.3% away - dormant support). Max Pain $688. Near support: $680 (60k OI - active), $640 (100k OI - dormant). Near resistance: $730 (48k OI), $750 (55k OI). QQQ ($619.43): Call Wall $620 (39k OI, 0.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI - dormant support). Max Pain $620. Near support: $590 (78k OI - active), $580 (108k OI). Near resistance: $630 (32k OI), $640 (31k OI). /ES: Per Twitter analysis, technical breakout setups mentioned but dormant put wall structure suggests downside buffers remain intact.",
