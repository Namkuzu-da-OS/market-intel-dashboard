    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is predominantly bullish (68-100% across sources) with strong thematic tailwinds, but technical momentum shows signs of exhaustion. Conviction: MEDIUM—bullish narratives are not yet contradicted by price action, but underlying breadth and reversal patterns warrant caution.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Rate-cut expectations and Fed policy accommodation supporting equities; (2) AI productivity gains and large-cap tech dominance (GOOG, AAPL, ORCL); (3) Cryptocurrency strength and potential asset rotation into risk-on positioning; (4) Regulatory headwinds in banking/fintech and software guidance deterioration creating sector selectivity; (5) Late-stage momentum exhaustion in sentiment-driven trades (silver, breadth deterioration at market highs).\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - active hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $686. Near support: $670 (45k OI - active), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - active at 1.0% away), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4% away). Max Pain $621. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI), $625 (29k OI - both active). Per Twitter analysis: /ES technical setup showing potential for sharp reversal if support levels break.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: 5-day consolidation expected near $686–$700 before potential test of $670 support (active GEX level). If $670 breaks, dormant support at $645 becomes target. QQQ: Near-term resistance at $630 call wall; breakdown below $621 (max pain) would target $590 put wall. Key inflection: Silver's 8% reversal and breadth warning at SPX highs historically precede 1–3 week corrections; watch for confirmation via Bitcoin strength deterioration.",
