    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Market sentiment is MIXED with medium conviction. Bullish sources (Twitter 78%, YouTube analysts on capex) emphasize forward-looking tailwinds (AI adoption, capital spending, regulatory easing), while bearish sources (Professional trader 87% bearish, RSS News 50/50) point to present-tense weakness: crypto underperformance despite bullish narrative, crude oil weakness, software guidance misses, and year-end liquidation pressure. The disconnect between bullish consensus and negative price action in risk assets suggests vulnerability.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) **Liquidity & Liquidation Risk** — Year-end profit-taking, low holiday volume, and margin call cascades creating downside momentum despite bullish sentiment; (2) **Policy Uncertainty** — Geopolitical escalation (China-Taiwan), banking regulatory tightening, and macro policy trajectory creating macro headwinds that offset near-term rate-cut optimism; (3) **Earnings Reality vs. Forward Expectations** — Enterprise software guidance misses, regulatory capital impacts, and sector-specific deterioration conflicting with structural AI/capex bull narrative.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.31): Call Wall $700 (146k OI - ACTIVE hedging at 1.4% away), Put Wall $640 (153k OI - dormant at 7.3% away). Max Pain $687. Near support: $670 (45k OI - ACTIVE at 2.9%), $645 (126k OI - dormant). QQQ ($623.89): Call Wall $630 (33k OI - ACTIVE at 1.0%), Put Wall $590 (164k OI - dormant at 5.4%). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $640 (31k OI - ACTIVE), $625 (29k OI - ACTIVE). Per Twitter: Crude oil support at WTI below $58/barrel, Brent at $61.67/barrel; Bitcoin 7% YTD decline despite bullish rhetoric.",
