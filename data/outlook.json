    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Mixed sentiment with moderate conviction - bullish themes (AI infrastructure, crypto legitimacy, Fed easing) coexist with structural bearish risks (stagflation concerns, tech valuation extremes, earnings disappointments). Quantitative data shows 80% bullish Twitter, 64% bullish news, 100% bullish YouTube/professional trader, but qualitative analysis reveals significant macro headwinds.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure and productivity tailwinds driving selective tech strength, (2) Crypto institutional adoption and regulatory normalization supporting digital assets, (3) Sector bifurcation with rotation from growth to defensive positioning amid guidance disappointments and valuation concerns.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($684 Max Pain): Call walls and put walls create option-driven support. QQQ ($619 Max Pain): Options structure suggests dealer positioning around this level. VIX at 13.77 indicates low volatility environment. Per Twitter: /ES futures support mentioned around 6847 (separate from SPY which trades ~$680s). Watch for tech rotation signals and defensive sector strength.",
