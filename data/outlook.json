    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** MIXED - Bullish positioning on mega-cap tech and AI infrastructure themes, but bearish structural concerns around valuation extremes (218% market cap-to-GDP), regulatory headwinds, and guidance cuts create cautious year-end positioning. Conviction: MEDIUM.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure dominance driving mega-cap tech outperformance despite broader market weakness, (2) Regulatory tightening creating sector-specific headwinds in financials and enterprise software, (3) Year-end liquidity constraints and elevated hedging activity favoring defensive rotation over aggressive accumulation.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($687.01): Call Wall $700 (144k OI, 1.9% away - active resistance), Put Wall $630 (143k OI, 8.3% away - dormant support). Max Pain $688. Near support: $680 (60k OI - active). QQQ ($619.43): Call Wall $620 (39k OI, 0.1% away - active resistance), Put Wall $574.78 (122k OI, 7.2% away - dormant support). Max Pain $620. Near resistance: $630 (32k OI - active). /ES: $96k Bitcoin breakout threshold per Twitter sentiment.",
