    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** BEARISH with MEDIUM conviction - Near-term technical damage (SPY broke 50-day MA, high-volume selling) outweighs bullish fundamentals, though structural themes (AI adoption, regulatory tailwinds for crypto) remain intact.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Technical breakdown vs. fundamental resilience - momentum loss clashing with strong earnings beats in semiconductors and regulatory clarity improvements; (2) Growth stall amid policy uncertainty - rate policy timing questions creating bifurcated outcomes between quality innovation plays and cyclical risk assets; (3) Labor market regime shift - unemployment trajectory since mid-year representing potential cycle inflection that could override tech optimism.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($671.40): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, 1.4% away - active resistance), Put Wall $670 (9k OI, 0.2% away - active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $669 (7k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($600.41): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, 2.4% away), Put Wall $595 (7k OI, 0.9% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $613 (11k OI), $610 (10k OI). Near support: $600 (6k OI), $597 (5k OI). Both showing BEARISH_RESISTANCE bias from dealer hedging.",
