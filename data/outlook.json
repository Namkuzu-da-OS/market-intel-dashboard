    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bearish with medium-high conviction. Near-term technical deterioration and first significant red trend day since late November signal downside pressure, though structural AI themes and seasonal Santa Rally window (10 days remaining) provide floor potential.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) AI infrastructure momentum vs. enterprise software guidance cuts creating sector divergence, (2) Labor market deterioration driving Fed rate cut expectations but raising recession risk concerns, (3) Energy sector weakness with crude oil five-month decline pressuring commodity-linked equities, (4) Year-end positioning tension between defensive rotation and seasonal bullish patterns.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($672.65): Call Wall $681 (17k OI - resistance 1.2% away), Put Wall $670 (9k OI - support 0.4% away). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $669 (7k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($601.97): Call Wall $615 (13k OI - resistance 2.2% away), Put Wall $595 (7k OI - support 1.2% away). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $610 (10k OI), $613 (11k OI). Near support: $600 (6k OI), $597 (5k OI). Both showing bearish resistance bias with active hedging zones engaged. /ES futures noted as under pressure per Twitter sources.",

    "swing_levels": "SPY: Critical support zone $665-$670 (Put Wall cluster with Max Pain). Break below activates deeper retracement toward dormant levels.

Max Pain $625 represents 3.8% upside target if bullish reversal materializes, but current bias suggests gravitational pull unlikely without catalyst.",
