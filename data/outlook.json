    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** BEARISH with MEDIUM-HIGH conviction. Sources converge on technical deterioration and capital outflows overriding bullish narratives, though Fed policy and AI themes provide structural support for swing timeframes.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Technical breakdown momentum - Bitcoin below 50-week MA, QQQ losing gap support, sustained crypto ETF outflows. (2) Earnings guidance pressure vs. AI productivity narratives - Enterprise software and fintech cuts colliding with long-term efficiency tailwinds. (3) Labor market inflection point - Employment data driving Fed dovish pivot, but disagreement on whether slowdown remains manageable or accelerates into deleveraging.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($674.45): Call Wall $681 (17k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $670 (9k OI, active support). Max Pain $670. Near resistance: $680 (16k OI), $685 (16k OI). Near support: $674 (8k OI), $665 (7k OI). QQQ ($604.32): Call Wall $615 (13k OI, active resistance), Put Wall $595 (7k OI, active support). Max Pain $625. Near resistance: $613 (11k OI), $610 (10k OI). Near support: $600 (6k OI), $603 (5k OI). Twitter mentions: QQQ 610 gap-up support failure, NVDA weakness below $174, Oracle below $181.50. Bitcoin at $10K target level per McGlone warning.",
