    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Bullish with medium conviction - sentiment across sources ranges 72-89% bullish, supported by rate cut expectations and AI infrastructure momentum, but with acknowledged structural risks around valuations and debt servicing costs.\n\n📈 **Themes:** (1) Fed rate cut trajectory and monetary policy easing supporting risk assets, (2) AI/technology infrastructure momentum driving selective strength in quality tech, (3) Valuation concerns and late-cycle positioning creating vulnerability to earnings disappointments and policy surprises.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($685.99): Call Wall $700 (146k OI, 2.0% away - active resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 6.7% away - dormant support). Max Pain $684. Near resistance: $750 (55k OI), $730 (47k OI). Near support: $645 (125k OI), $650 (38k OI). QQQ ($619.79): Call Wall $640 (35k OI, 3.3% away - active resistance), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 4.8% away - active support). Max Pain $619. Near resistance: $620 (33k OI - ACTIVE). Near support: $585 (137k OI). Twitter mentions /ES: Pentagon contract catalysts and defense sector strength per Twitter commentary.",
