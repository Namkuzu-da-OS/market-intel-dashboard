    "narrative": "📊 **Consensus:** Moderately bullish sentiment with medium conviction. X (74% bullish), RSS (67% bullish), and professional sources (100% bullish) align on constructive bias, though near-term technical concerns and rate policy uncertainty temper enthusiasm.\n\n📈 **Themes:** AI sector momentum and compute dominance narrative remains the primary driver. Rate policy uncertainty and suppressed rate-cut expectations creating near-term headwinds. Defensive rotation into safe-haven assets (precious metals, Treasuries) amid geopolitical risk backdrop.\n\n🎯 **Levels:** SPY ($690.38): Call Wall $700 (150k OI, 1.4% away - ACTIVE resistance), Put Wall $640 (153k OI, 7.3% away - dormant). Max Pain $684. Near support: $645 (125k OI), $650 (41k OI). QQQ ($623.93): Call Wall $640 (31k OI, 2.6% away - ACTIVE), Near resistance $630 (30k OI - ACTIVE), Put Wall $590 (164k OI, 5.4% - dormant). Max Pain $617.",
