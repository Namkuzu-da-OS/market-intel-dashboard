# Reports Drop Zone

Drop AI-generated HTML reports here. They will be accessible via the Research Library.

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive filenames:
- `2025-11-28_fed-policy-outlook.html`
- `2025-11-25_tsla-deep-dive.html`
- `2025-11-22_btc-etf-flows.html`

## Future Enhancement

The research.html page can be enhanced to:
1. Automatically scan this folder
2. Parse report metadata (title, date, category)
3. Dynamically generate the card grid

For now, manually link reports by updating research.html.
